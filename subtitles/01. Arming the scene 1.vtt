1
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.480
Setting the scene

2
00:00:09.153 --> 00:00:12.913
We already have our
material ready to start animating.

3
00:00:12.913 --> 00:00:15.698
In the first lesson, we
will open After Effects

4
00:00:15.698 --> 00:00:17.820
and we will begin
to prepare the scene.

5
00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:24.373
Now, finally, we can get
full with After Effects

6
00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:26.098
And start with the animation.

7
00:00:26.728 --> 00:00:30.108
First we will prepare
the scene, but before that

8
00:00:30.108 --> 00:00:33.018
I recommend putting
together a folder structure

9
00:00:33.018 --> 00:00:34.785
To keep everything tidy.

10
00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:38.963
I first create one to
which I put Rendercomps,

11
00:00:38.963 --> 00:00:41.665
basically, here are
going to go precomps

12
00:00:41.665 --> 00:00:44.073
that will come out
directly from rendering.

13
00:00:44.073 --> 00:00:47.695
In our case, only the
final animation will go.

14
00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:50.160
Then another folder for precomps.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.680
We sort this by name.

16
00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.960
I put the script low
so it always stays up.

17
00:00:56.133 --> 00:00:57.560
Another for Assets

18
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.583
and alone solids will be created.

19
00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:03.973
I also recommend using the tags

20
00:01:03.973 --> 00:01:06.295
which are usually hidden out there.

21
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.395
Color the compositions of the folders

22
00:01:10.395 --> 00:01:13.248
Sometimes it helps us a
little to get organized.

23
00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:16.233
So, if we order by color order,

24
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.920
We can use to highlight some comps.

25
00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:21.688
The first thing we are
going to do is import

26
00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:25.033
Animatic project or
export, if we have it ready.

27
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.520
We will use our Animatic comp

28
00:01:29.538 --> 00:01:31.875
and we will create a
new comp from that.

29
00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:36.200
This we will take to Rendercomps
because it will be our final animation.

30
00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:38.195
We are going to put Comp.

31
00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:41.683
Animatic, the
precomp we take to Precomps

32
00:01:41.683 --> 00:01:43.683
and everything else we can put in,

33
00:01:43.683 --> 00:01:45.663
except Solids, we take it out

34
00:01:45.663 --> 00:01:48.253
and the rest we can put in Assets.

35
00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:50.398
Then we will continue to import things

36
00:01:50.398 --> 00:01:53.988
And we will import
all our styleframes.

37
00:01:53.988 --> 00:01:55.762
Let's put import folder.

38
00:01:55.762 --> 00:01:57.298
So we already have a folder

39
00:01:57.298 --> 00:01:59.593
with all the images
of the styleframes.

40
00:01:59.593 --> 00:02:01.507
We also send this to Assets.

41
00:02:01.507 --> 00:02:03.547
And finally, all our material.

42
00:02:03.547 --> 00:02:05.128
We will enter the folder

43
00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:08.170
and select all the Illustrator files

44
00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.348
and we will make sure to mark it as:

45
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.800
Composition - Maintain Layer Sizes.

46
00:02:13.648 --> 00:02:18.228
We are going to import this and
what it does is import all precomps

47
00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:20.397
With the designs we
already have ready.

48
00:02:20.397 --> 00:02:21.980
Let's clean up a little here

49
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.613
and we will take all
the layers of Illustrator

50
00:02:24.613 --> 00:02:25.962
to the Assets folder,

51
00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:28.770
and we will work with these precomps.

52
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.023
So, first we can start
by importing the fund

53
00:02:32.023 --> 00:02:33.863
and we can import

54
00:02:34.575 --> 00:02:37.758
All our styleframes to
have them as a reference.

55
00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:40.688
To all layers of
styleframes and animatic

56
00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:42.293
We will put them as a guide.

57
00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:45.723
I sometimes put a black color,
so they do not stand out much.

58
00:02:45.723 --> 00:02:49.088
As we create the
composition from that of the animatic,

59
00:02:49.088 --> 00:02:51.223
that we already had it set,

60
00:02:51.223 --> 00:02:53.940
we already have more
or less the duration,

61
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.938
dimensions and pictures per second.

62
00:02:56.938 --> 00:02:58.207
If we enter Animatic

63
00:02:58.207 --> 00:03:02.973
We see that our total animation
lasts approximately 16 seconds.

64
00:03:02.973 --> 00:03:06.520
Then, we can make our
general comp last the same.

65
00:03:07.315 --> 00:03:10.635
All layers of styleframes
are saved as a reference

66
00:03:10.635 --> 00:03:13.743
and we work with the first scene
that is the one in the background.

67
00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:15.775
Let's get the bottom

68
00:03:15.983 --> 00:03:18.257
with Ctrl + Shift + C in a new precomp

69
00:03:18.257 --> 00:03:20.060
What can we call scene_01.

70
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.847
Let's make sure to
mark the second option

71
00:03:22.847 --> 00:03:25.768
to create a new
composition with it inside.

72
00:03:25.768 --> 00:03:28.067
We will select the first styleframe

73
00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:32.342
and we are going to copy the
animatic and take it into this scene.

74
00:03:32.342 --> 00:03:34.590
We will work first in this scene

75
00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.153
and then we will go,

76
00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:37.933
as we go forward,

77
00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:40.700
creating new scenes and we
will be adding them here.

78
00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.417
For now we focus on the first scene.

79
00:03:44.365 --> 00:03:47.870
With the animatic as a
reference, we can multiply it,

80
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.430
since it has black lines,

81
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.995
and lower the opacity a little.

82
00:03:50.995 --> 00:03:52.293
The first thing we will do

83
00:03:52.293 --> 00:03:55.853
is to accommodate the
bottom to match the scale we have

84
00:03:55.853 --> 00:03:58.720
in our animatic or in our styleframe.

85
00:03:59.095 --> 00:04:00.908
We can also use this

86
00:04:00.908 --> 00:04:03.428
to have as a reference for sizes.

87
00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:06.178
I usually put Layer Mode Difference

88
00:04:06.178 --> 00:04:08.658
to show us a very high contrast

89
00:04:08.658 --> 00:04:11.567
between the differences
between one layer and another.

90
00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:13.305
So, if we scale the bottom

91
00:04:13.305 --> 00:04:16.168
we can make it more or less match

92
00:04:16.168 --> 00:04:18.460
with what we have in our styleframe,

93
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.010
and locate it correctly.

94
00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.593
Our background has
layers of Illustrator,

95
00:04:22.593 --> 00:04:24.945
if we give F4 we
see all these columns.

96
00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.660
When we mark the layers of
Illustrator with this little star

97
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.953
which means "rasterize continuously",

98
00:04:30.953 --> 00:04:34.028
we will make sure that
when we scale the objects

99
00:04:34.028 --> 00:04:37.702
They will always look
sharp, always sharp.

100
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.880
If we take that out, let's
see that the pixels are scaled.

101
00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.320
We do not want that.

102
00:04:43.863 --> 00:04:47.643
We make sure that the entire
fund is marked with a little star

103
00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:51.093
and that the Background Layer
itself is marked with a star.

104
00:04:51.093 --> 00:04:54.325
Thus, when we climb the
bottom, everything looks clear.

105
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.495
That's the good thing about
working with vector objects.

106
00:04:57.495 --> 00:04:59.733
and not with
Photoshop with bitmap files,

107
00:04:59.733 --> 00:05:02.333
because in that case
everyone would break,

108
00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.778
but taking advantage of the vector

109
00:05:04.778 --> 00:05:07.965
We can keep everything
always clear very easily.

110
00:05:07.965 --> 00:05:10.355
So, we continue to
accommodate our background

111
00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.238
to locate it more or
less where it has to go.

112
00:05:14.628 --> 00:05:17.162
What the layer does in
Layer Mode Difference

113
00:05:17.855 --> 00:05:20.765
is that it shows us with
black the things that match.

114
00:05:20.765 --> 00:05:23.688
When we see that what
matters to us coincides in black

115
00:05:23.688 --> 00:05:25.500
we can change the Layer Mode

116
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.653
and we can see if it is more
or less where it has to go.

117
00:05:28.653 --> 00:05:31.360
I think the floor
could go a little lower.

118
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.960
No, above.

119
00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:38.147
The scale I think is still a bit big.

120
00:05:39.543 --> 00:05:40.835
There is pretty good,

121
00:05:40.835 --> 00:05:43.138
does not match
exactly for some reason,

122
00:05:43.138 --> 00:05:45.350
but for now this is enough

123
00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.020
because we are not
working with great precision.

124
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.200
First of all, let's save our
project: Domestika_Animation.

125
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.413
Now that we have our fund located,

126
00:05:54.413 --> 00:05:57.948
we will modify it to
match the first scene,

127
00:05:57.948 --> 00:05:59.667
which, according to our styleframe,

128
00:05:59.667 --> 00:06:03.293
It has the lights off and the
columns a little further to the right.

129
00:06:03.293 --> 00:06:05.580
I'm going to take that
reference styleframe,

130
00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.052
I will go inside the background and
I will paste the styleframe guide.

131
00:06:10.688 --> 00:06:13.908
What I want to do with
this is to have a reference

132
00:06:13.908 --> 00:06:16.023
where are things going to go from?

133
00:06:16.023 --> 00:06:18.818
So, now, the opposite
of how we did recently

134
00:06:18.818 --> 00:06:20.273
that we enlarge the bottom

135
00:06:20.273 --> 00:06:22.463
let's shrink the styleframe layer

136
00:06:22.463 --> 00:06:26.198
to have more or less as a
reference the location of the columns.

137
00:06:26.485 --> 00:06:28.640
We see that
according to the styleframe

138
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.947
the columns go a
little further to the right.

139
00:06:30.947 --> 00:06:35.442
Luckily we have them well
separated and we can move them easily.

140
00:06:35.442 --> 00:06:38.335
I am going to link the
Column_light to the Column_ Capa.

141
00:06:39.103 --> 00:06:43.083
I separate the dimensions because we
know that they will move only in X.

142
00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:46.208
I turn this frame into a holdframe.

143
00:06:46.208 --> 00:06:47.522
I'll leave later

144
00:06:47.522 --> 00:06:50.618
because I want to maintain
this position at some point.

145
00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:54.763
We will modify the initial
position to match the styleframe,

146
00:06:54.763 --> 00:06:56.097
It would be more or less there.

147
00:06:56.097 --> 00:06:59.908
I turn it into a holdframe so
it stays fixed without animating.

148
00:06:59.908 --> 00:07:04.238
We leave this frame
saved, then we will reuse it.

149
00:07:04.238 --> 00:07:06.740
For now we focus on the first scene.

150
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.338
I can already hide
this reference styleframe

151
00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.197
and what we should keep
in mind is that the light

152
00:07:13.197 --> 00:07:15.955
It will not be present at
the beginning of the scene.

153
00:07:15.955 --> 00:07:18.580
So, let's select the layers of light,

154
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.838
we paint them in one
color to identify them

155
00:07:21.838 --> 00:07:23.487
and hide them, for now.

156
00:07:23.487 --> 00:07:26.235
We are going to move
it quite to the right

157
00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:29.670
to keep them, but that do
not affect in the beginning.

158
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:31.948
With Tab we can go
back to the previous comp

159
00:07:31.948 --> 00:07:33.598
and see if everything is in order.

160
00:07:33.598 --> 00:07:36.413
We compare our scene
with the initial styleframe

161
00:07:36.413 --> 00:07:37.918
And it's pretty good.

162
00:07:37.918 --> 00:07:41.238
The only thing we have
different is the diamond holder,

163
00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:44.558
which in our styleframe
is a little more dark blue.

164
00:07:44.558 --> 00:07:47.635
Then we will grab that object

165
00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:52.350
and the first thing we are going to
do is create shapes from the vector.

166
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.023
We are going to do
this a lot in our project

167
00:07:55.023 --> 00:07:59.603
because it will allow us to edit
the layers within that same object.

168
00:07:59.603 --> 00:08:01.305
We will go to its contents.

169
00:08:02.413 --> 00:08:04.828
We see that we have three groups.

170
00:08:04.828 --> 00:08:06.330
We can hide them

171
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:09.943
and we realize that the third
one is the one we need to edit.

172
00:08:09.943 --> 00:08:12.818
From here we want to
change the color of the stroke.

173
00:08:12.818 --> 00:08:14.533
Then let's animate it.

174
00:08:14.533 --> 00:08:17.808
We are going to keep
it leading to the right

175
00:08:17.808 --> 00:08:21.113
and we will choose the color
that corresponds to this scene,

176
00:08:21.113 --> 00:08:23.195
That is a darker blue.

177
00:08:23.195 --> 00:08:27.235
Then, again we hold it so that
it remains without animation.

178
00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:30.557
Returning to the first scene, we
see that everything is perfect.

179
00:08:30.557 --> 00:08:33.875
So, now we can show our animatic

180
00:08:33.875 --> 00:08:36.663
and see when things start to change.

181
00:08:36.663 --> 00:08:38.798
The first scene we will see that lasts

182
00:08:38.798 --> 00:08:41.493
while the light
appears, when the girl falls,

183
00:08:41.493 --> 00:08:44.320
and cut when we approach the camera.

184
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.853
So leaving some more tolerance frames

185
00:08:47.853 --> 00:08:51.373
we can trim the first scene
more or less at 5 seconds.

186
00:08:52.613 --> 00:08:54.953
Now we see that
according to our animatic

187
00:08:54.953 --> 00:08:59.138
more or less in the second
1.5 the light begins to appear.

188
00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:02.575
Then we can set
that in the background.

189
00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:05.273
We take advantage of
that with After Effects

190
00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:07.495
when we double click on a precomp

191
00:09:07.495 --> 00:09:10.320
It keeps us the time we stand.

192
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.945
We are at the moment
when the light comes on

193
00:09:12.945 --> 00:09:16.573
and we can make our layers
begin at that right moment.

194
00:09:17.368 --> 00:09:20.663
Then, in the second 1.5
the lights will come on.

195
00:09:20.663 --> 00:09:23.018
Then we can animate
them a little better,

196
00:09:23.018 --> 00:09:24.658
But for now that's fine.

197
00:09:24.658 --> 00:09:26.770
Let's start with the thickest

198
00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:28.838
and little by little we
will be adding details.

199
00:09:28.838 --> 00:09:31.705
According to our Animatic,
following it as a reference,

200
00:09:31.705 --> 00:09:33.318
from the second two

201
00:09:33.318 --> 00:09:35.458
Our character appears up there.

202
00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:38.985
As it will be animated, it will
probably start appearing earlier,

203
00:09:38.985 --> 00:09:42.293
but for now we will
place it only as a reference.

204
00:09:42.293 --> 00:09:45.355
We are looking for our
character, which appears with a rope,

205
00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:47.760
and we have it start right now,

206
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.637
and with the animatic as a reference
we will place it where it has to go.

207
00:09:51.637 --> 00:09:54.938
The next thing that happens is
that our character falls to the floor.

208
00:09:55.563 --> 00:09:58.520
Let's make this precomp end there

209
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.670
and then the character
appears on the floor.

210
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:06.220
As we always kept the scale
when making our illustrations,

211
00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.348
now we can import the object

212
00:10:08.348 --> 00:10:10.855
and it will be on the scale we need,

213
00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:13.808
beyond the
composition itself being larger.

214
00:10:13.808 --> 00:10:15.682
We can hide our animatic

215
00:10:15.682 --> 00:10:18.138
because we no longer
need it as a reference.

216
00:10:18.138 --> 00:10:20.783
And we place our
character a little better.

217
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.800
We see that there is quite good.

218
00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:26.830
So, if we go to the original comp

219
00:10:29.138 --> 00:10:31.553
We can already hide our animatic.

220
00:10:31.553 --> 00:10:34.497
We will always have it
as a reference anyway.

221
00:10:34.497 --> 00:10:37.683
We already have our first
scene, practically ready.

222
00:10:37.683 --> 00:10:39.507
Of course we need to animate it,

223
00:10:39.507 --> 00:10:42.127
but we have more or
less things in place.

224
00:10:42.127 --> 00:10:46.130
So we will continue with the others
to have a first base of everything.

225
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.985
First we make sure
that at Rendercomps,

226
00:10:48.985 --> 00:10:50.808
We only have the main comp,

227
00:10:50.808 --> 00:10:52.573
So we are ordering a little.
