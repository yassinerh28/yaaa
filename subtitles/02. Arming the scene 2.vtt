1
00:00:03.518 --> 00:00:08.480
Setting the scene

2
00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.510
Now, we use our
animatic as a reference and see

3
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.497
that the next scene we have

4
00:00:16.497 --> 00:00:18.267
It is the approach of the face.

5
00:00:18.267 --> 00:00:20.665
Then, let's put the expensive object.

6
00:00:20.665 --> 00:00:24.213
We are going to create
a comp called Scene_02,

7
00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:26.333
It's going to start right now.

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.973
Actually, as our
animatic starts before,

9
00:00:31.243 --> 00:00:33.043
From this moment.

10
00:00:33.043 --> 00:00:35.373
Let's copy the styleframe first

11
00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:40.255
from scene two

12
00:00:41.843 --> 00:00:44.030
and we will enter our scene two.

13
00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:47.955
Ah, it's not
styleframe two, it's three.

14
00:00:49.018 --> 00:00:52.873
The way we name our
scenes on the storyboard

15
00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:54.815
It may be different
from the one we use

16
00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:58.073
to name scenes in
our animation project,

17
00:00:58.073 --> 00:01:01.975
because maybe in the
precomp of Scene_01

18
00:01:01.975 --> 00:01:04.435
we have three scenes
from the storyboard,

19
00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:05.870
two or three, or whatever,

20
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.847
and the next one is
going to be Scene_02.

21
00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:11.895
So, let's skip some storyboard numbers

22
00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:14.188
just to keep it consecutive.

23
00:01:14.188 --> 00:01:16.488
We make sure this is in Guide.

24
00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:20.457
And we are going to add the
bottom, maybe with some solid,

25
00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:24.227
since the background was not
prepared as Asset in this scene,

26
00:01:24.227 --> 00:01:26.675
but being so simple
we have no problem.

27
00:01:26.675 --> 00:01:29.113
We can generate some shape layers,

28
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.830
and since the
styleframes were exported as PNG,

29
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.113
we are sure that the color they have

30
00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:38.170
That's the right one.

31
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.770
Sometimes JPEGs have some compression

32
00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.500
which makes the colors change a bit.

33
00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.065
We can put these two comps together

34
00:01:48.065 --> 00:01:51.153
in one that is bottom-approach.

35
00:01:58.583 --> 00:02:02.413
Now we need to have the
animatic as a reference for this scene.

36
00:02:02.413 --> 00:02:05.950
We will return to our initial
comp where we have the animatic

37
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.403
And what we do is duplicate it.

38
00:02:08.403 --> 00:02:11.238
We will cut it from that moment.

39
00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:13.270
I'm going to put
color to make it look.

40
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.578
We will keep the beginning in
the beginning, in the second 0,

41
00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:20.385
but we are going to cut it at
the moment when Comp_02 begins.

42
00:02:20.385 --> 00:02:24.273
I cut it, carry it inside
and carry it at the beginning.

43
00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:28.465
So I make sure that the two
comps are starting at the same time.

44
00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:31.718
Thus we have the animatic as
a reference for this scene.

45
00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:33.348
We will go forward and see

46
00:02:33.348 --> 00:02:36.483
that about 3 seconds
later the scene is cut.

47
00:02:36.483 --> 00:02:39.695
So, we can give it a
second more tolerance,

48
00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:41.560
of surplus, just in case.

49
00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.520
Let's see that here our
character appears looking to the left

50
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.692
and halfway around, turn
your head to the other side.

51
00:02:48.692 --> 00:02:50.453
So, in the face layer

52
00:02:50.453 --> 00:02:52.733
we are going to put a marker right now

53
00:02:54.308 --> 00:02:56.678
and we will finish the scene here.

54
00:02:56.678 --> 00:03:00.090
What we are going to do now
is that from this moment on

55
00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.478
Assets with number
two ahead are displayed,

56
00:03:03.478 --> 00:03:05.793
They are face facing the other side.

57
00:03:05.793 --> 00:03:08.378
There, more or less, we
have the return of face.

58
00:03:08.378 --> 00:03:10.493
This we will later encourage better,

59
00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:13.752
But for now, to
assemble a skeleton, it's fine.

60
00:03:15.068 --> 00:03:17.742
It doesn't matter if the
timing doesn't match exactly,

61
00:03:17.742 --> 00:03:22.000
If the timing of our animation does
not match exactly with the animatic,

62
00:03:22.868 --> 00:03:26.220
because it is simply a
reference that is flexible.

63
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.660
We are going to adjust it

64
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.860
when we work better in animation.

65
00:03:30.368 --> 00:03:32.270
So we have scene two.

66
00:03:32.993 --> 00:03:36.237
In the same way we continue
with the rest of the scenes.

67
00:03:52.588 --> 00:03:54.658
This scene has a small zoom

68
00:03:56.883 --> 00:03:59.997
that we are going to see if
we do it here with a Null I

69
00:03:59.997 --> 00:04:02.300
It may be centered on the diamond.

70
00:04:05.173 --> 00:04:09.110
Maybe it's not exactly like
that, but we'll refine it later.

71
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.920
For now I will not
worry about the reflection,

72
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.428
because we can add that later.

73
00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.110
These styleframes

74
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.593
for now they are not necessary,

75
00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:58.933
It is better to use
them within each comp.

76
00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:06.433
We use the same background
layer again with the other pose

77
00:05:06.433 --> 00:05:08.018
for the next scene,

78
00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:10.857
that probably scene five

79
00:05:10.857 --> 00:05:13.173
be the same until the end,

80
00:05:14.043 --> 00:05:16.570
since there are no
big camera movements,

81
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.940
Only one movement to the side.

82
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.488
And more or less
here the animation ends.

83
00:05:34.683 --> 00:05:37.210
As this background has
another different animation

84
00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.873
to the one in animation_01,

85
00:05:38.873 --> 00:05:42.320
we will look for this
fund in our precomps,

86
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.407
let's double it

87
00:05:44.407 --> 00:05:47.833
and we are going to put Final,
because it is the bottom of the end,

88
00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:50.658
and we will use that
fund instead of the first.

89
00:05:50.658 --> 00:05:52.807
To this we are going
to put bottom-initial.

90
00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:55.998
So, now we take the same styleframe

91
00:05:55.998 --> 00:05:57.483
and entering the final fund

92
00:05:57.483 --> 00:05:59.815
we are going to do the
same thing we just did

93
00:05:59.815 --> 00:06:02.017
to have the reference styleframe.

94
00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:05.578
Now we are going to make
the lights from the beginning.

95
00:06:06.585 --> 00:06:10.515
The color of the diamond
holder is what we had put

96
00:06:10.515 --> 00:06:14.328
in the keyframe we had,
which was the initial one,

97
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.813
and supposedly the columns

98
00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:20.468
they are also the ones we had
in the keyframe we had saved,

99
00:06:21.213 --> 00:06:26.345
since the initial drawing of the
background was based on this styleframe.

100
00:06:26.345 --> 00:06:29.318
If we reset it, it will center us

101
00:06:29.318 --> 00:06:32.088
and there we will see that we
are locating everything well.

102
00:06:32.088 --> 00:06:35.943
Then, we can eliminate it because
it is not necessary as a reference.

103
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:40.612
If we go to the initial background,
which we always use in the first scene,

104
00:06:40.612 --> 00:06:43.620
We can delete those keyframes,

105
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.755
since we are already
using them in our final fund.

106
00:06:46.755 --> 00:06:50.527
So, scene five we have almost ready.

107
00:06:51.563 --> 00:06:53.868
We use our styleframe as a reference

108
00:06:53.868 --> 00:06:56.870
and we place the character
more or less where he has to go.

109
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.647
This is going to be animated,

110
00:06:58.647 --> 00:07:01.128
so there's not much
problem if it doesn't match.

111
00:07:01.128 --> 00:07:03.398
We will start using color codes

112
00:07:03.398 --> 00:07:05.438
To differentiate some things.

113
00:07:05.438 --> 00:07:09.583
We are going to put the character
fuchsia, since it has a medium violet color,

114
00:07:09.583 --> 00:07:11.333
and the funds can be cyan.

115
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.840
We will do the same in scene one.

116
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.600
In scene two

117
00:07:17.823 --> 00:07:19.795
the animatic is black,

118
00:07:19.795 --> 00:07:21.678
All references are black.

119
00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:26.213
In Scene_03 we have only the diamond,

120
00:07:26.213 --> 00:07:28.310
It doesn't take much color code.

121
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.948
Here, the boot is fuchsia because
it corresponds to the character.

122
00:07:32.498 --> 00:07:36.258
The background is cyan, here we
have it separated into two objects.

123
00:07:36.258 --> 00:07:38.858
and in scene five, we are ready.

124
00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.460
Now we are going to do the same

125
00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:43.205
Take the animatic as a
reference at that point.

126
00:07:47.498 --> 00:07:49.448
Here is a camera movement

127
00:07:49.448 --> 00:07:51.953
that for now we are
going to do it with a Null I.

128
00:07:54.508 --> 00:07:56.580
We're going to animate only in X,

129
00:07:57.598 --> 00:08:00.800
but we are going to adjust
it better when we go further,

130
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.420
because thereâ€™s going to be
a Parallax with the columns,

131
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:05.072
Several things will change.

132
00:08:05.885 --> 00:08:08.847
Anyway, we give it a
bit of acceleration.

133
00:08:09.208 --> 00:08:11.660
And what we have to
include here finally

134
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.882
is the character standing

135
00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.328
and the walking character.

136
00:08:20.328 --> 00:08:23.023
I will duplicate this
to hold the position,

137
00:08:23.023 --> 00:08:24.505
and I will add hike

138
00:08:24.505 --> 00:08:27.027
to make sure it's at the same height.

139
00:08:27.027 --> 00:08:29.988
We are going to accommodate
the location of these things,

140
00:08:29.988 --> 00:08:33.682
but for now we just want
to have a kind of skeleton.

141
00:08:43.803 --> 00:08:47.290
We will put our layers
with the corresponding colors

142
00:08:48.075 --> 00:08:49.953
to locate us a little more.

143
00:08:55.228 --> 00:08:57.943
And the scenes can have a color ...

144
00:08:57.943 --> 00:09:00.817
Match the colors here with these

145
00:09:00.817 --> 00:09:04.713
It helps us maintain a
consistency in our head

146
00:09:04.713 --> 00:09:08.630
and so we place the
comps in the tab easier.

147
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.155
When we have an orange open we
already know that it is a scene.

148
00:09:12.758 --> 00:09:15.473
So we can hide the animatic

149
00:09:15.473 --> 00:09:18.462
and we already have a first
skeleton of our animation.

150
00:09:19.668 --> 00:09:20.967
The only thing missing here

151
00:09:20.967 --> 00:09:24.563
is that the new
characters accompany the camera.

152
00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.000
Having already assembled a
basic structure of our project

153
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.363
We can continue adding animation.
