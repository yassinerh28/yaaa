00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.480
First steps

2
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.893
Now that we have the base
structure of the entire sequence,

3
00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:14.780
We can start creating
animation in detail.

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.600
Let's start with the first scene.

5
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's go to Scene 1 and
let's start with the background,

6
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.100
it has this light
that suddenly appears

7
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.380
and I add some animation to this.

8
00:00:30.398 --> 00:00:36.180
First we are going to convert the
layers we want to animate to vector layers.

9
00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.178
Let's create, convert layers.

10
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.520
We return to the color we wanted,
the others we can change the color

11
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.100
and just leave them
there, just in case.

12
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.540
When we convert the wall
light layer to vectors,

13
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.320
we encountered a problem,

14
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.240
And the mask we had in
Illustrator stopped working.

15
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.260
For that reason I avoid using masks
but, in truth, it really happened to me.

16
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.620
On the other hand, let's
hide this effects panel,

17
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.358
since for now we will not use it.

18
00:01:11.358 --> 00:01:15.780
To solve this, let's see
the groups of that layer

19
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.180
and we will hide the layer of light.

20
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.783
Thus we leave the objects that
we want to be inside the mask.

21
00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:27.260
We are going to duplicate this
layer and we are going to put Luz matte,

22
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.860
because this will be the mask
we will use to show the objects.

23
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.820
In this case, we show the
light layer and, unlike the other,

24
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.820
We eliminate all the rest.

25
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.780
So, on the one hand we
have the light mask layer

26
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.140
and, on the other
hand, the objects inside,

27
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.440
To this we put Alpha and we
already have the masked objects.

28
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.140
Now we lack the
backlight, the light itself.

29
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.860
Then we double the layer
of light we already have,

30
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.100
This will simply be Light,
and we will show this layer.

31
00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.180
Then we have everything working.

32
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.380
Now, to be able to animate that layer

33
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.660
and that the mask be
animated at the same time,

34
00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.140
We are going to link the Paths as we
did at the beginning of the course.

35
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.913
The Path of the mask we will
link it with that of the light

36
00:02:12.913 --> 00:02:15.780
and, in turn, the layer
with the layer itself.

37
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.980
Now, every time we
move the layer of light,

38
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.388
masked objects will also move.

39
00:02:21.388 --> 00:02:22.540
I don't know if it shows much

40
00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.260
because the colors have
a very subtle variation

41
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.540
but if I change the color,
there you will notice a little more

42
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.900
and we will see how
the objects remain masked

43
00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.393
While we move the mask.

44
00:02:33.393 --> 00:02:35.553
So now we can animate this Path

45
00:02:35.553 --> 00:02:38.108
and the mask will be
automatically animated,

46
00:02:38.108 --> 00:02:41.845
That's why this layer,
for now, we can block.

47
00:02:41.845 --> 00:02:45.020
To animate this, we will
do something very simple,

48
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.620
we are going to leave that frame
there and we are going to move the vector,

49
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.620
as if it appeared from the center.

50
00:02:54.453 --> 00:02:58.220
Maybe not totally because there is
no need to show the entire transition

51
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.180
But it does create the
feeling that it appears.

52
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.180
Maybe doing so ...

53
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.940
It's fine but it's too slow.

54
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.780
Something like that is fine,
maybe it should be more sudden,

55
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.780
so we raise this a little more.

56
00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.220
Something like that.

57
00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.740
We will do the same
for the column layers.

58
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.140
On the other hand, we had
to hide the layers of columns

59
00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.740
which is behind when
the new one is turned on,

60
00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.900
since itâ€™s very subtle
but, if we zoom a lot,

61
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.540
let's see what the layer is behind

62
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.060
and it should be hidden,

63
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.540
especially it shows in that type of
design where we play with the same colors.

64
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.398
Then the muted layer is hidden

65
00:03:47.138 --> 00:03:50.260
and when this is turned
on, we will do the same

66
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.260
and we are going to
look for all the Paths.

67
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.660
I usually select all Paths
and add a first keyframe to all.

68
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.260
As much as finally,
you won't animate all of them,

69
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.260
but already having the keyframes,

70
00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.100
I make sure that if I move
something, it will animate.

71
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.780
Then we match all these keyframes

72
00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:12.180
with that of the other layer
and we will animate these layers.

73
00:04:13.563 --> 00:04:15.140
I think it could be
something like that.

74
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.300
This top does not matter if it looks
bad, because that will not be seen.

75
00:04:21.018 --> 00:04:23.540
It can be something like that,
just the acceleration is missing.

76
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.940
Once we move the objects
that we know we want to move,

77
00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.740
we eliminate the keyframes of the layers
that we do not animate, so they do not bother,

78
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.160
and press U to show
us the animated layers.

79
00:04:35.738 --> 00:04:38.220
We will modify the
acceleration of this.

80
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.420
Now what we have to do
is that this acceleration

81
00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.843
match the one we already added here.

82
00:04:43.843 --> 00:04:47.980
If we did it from the beginning, we
would work all the keyframes together

83
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.660
but, since we did this
first and we liked it,

84
00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.020
We will copy this data for this.

85
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.900
We are going to simulate
this curve in these two curves.

86
00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.260
For that, if we do Alt +
double click on the keyframe,

87
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.700
It will show us the
acceleration information.

88
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.088
The curve is
constructed with this data.

89
00:05:06.088 --> 00:05:10.060
This shows us the input
speed and the output speed.

90
00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.140
In this case, the
input does not matter

91
00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.420
because we don't have
keyframes before this one,

92
00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.020
what matters is the output, what
is to the right of the keyframe.

93
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.780
We are going to copy the speed
and it has 33.333% influence.

94
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.708
That influence occurs
only when we press F9.

95
00:05:26.708 --> 00:05:30.190
If we do Alt + double
click, we will have that data.

96
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.260
We just hit the speed and do
the same with the other keyframe,

97
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.300
in this case, it is the one of
"incoming", the one of entrance,

98
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.540
Because it's like the final keyframe.

99
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.940
This one has zero and one hundred, which
is what it gives us when we carry X frame.

100
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.420
With F9, it comes down and we
stretch the hands everything it gives.

101
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.620
In that case, if we show
all Paths at the same time,

102
00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.408
They all have the same curve.

103
00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:57.000
So now they are
going to move in unison.

104
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.700
I think that's fine for now.

105
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:12.020
Let's not forget to save and now
we will continue with the character.

106
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.500
When we start animating,

107
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.980
we must go thinking
what we want to do,

108
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.860
in this case, in our story,
the character appears from above

109
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.380
and in a moment he jumps
and falls into this position.

110
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.940
What I intended with this scene was for
the character to go down to that point

111
00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.300
where you can't see her face

112
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.180
The scene shows the
character completely.

113
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.300
We are going to do
that in this first scene,

114
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.460
The character appears
from nowhere and then jump.

115
00:06:42.613 --> 00:06:47.660
For that, I will see, in this
case, how far the composition goes,

116
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.140
which is right there,
up to the shoulder or so,

117
00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:54.500
and when I enter this layer, I
will add a reference guideline

118
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.100
to have an approximate idea

119
00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.540
how far the composition will show us,

120
00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:01.740
because the idea is that
we don't move this layer,

121
00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:05.340
that we don't do this
displacement like this, unless necessary,

122
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.060
maybe it is or we can
adjust some things like that

123
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.180
but we will try, if
possible, to animate

124
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.860
All movements within this layer.

125
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.420
I'm going to block the
guide, so it doesn't bother me,

126
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.220
and we will start to set our
layers to animate the character.

127
00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.700
First we will select everything
and we will convert to vector layers.

128
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:28.200
Taking advantage of the fact that
doing so are all the selected layers,

129
00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.320
let's move all the layers up.

130
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.980
For now, I usually
leave Illustrator layers

131
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.520
in case we have to do some update,

132
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.240
some change or reverse
something, but we leave them hidden.

133
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.860
Sometimes I take the
time to rename the layers

134
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.820
because, by default, it
adds "outlines" or contours.

135
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:51.620
Sometimes I take the time to
remove it, just to make it more neat

136
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.180
and it is easier for us
to identify the layers.

137
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.660
Now we will continue, putting
a little color to the layers

138
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.320
to identify them easier.

139
00:08:02.673 --> 00:08:06.700
Generally, the main element
of a character is the torso,

140
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.840
It is the one that will guide us
the movement of the whole body.

141
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:12.120
We will try to link all that torso,

142
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.280
That's why I give it
a very striking color.

143
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.680
We can put a color for
legs and a color for the arms,

144
00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:22.420
the hair may be a red
color, that is, if possible,

145
00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.100
I try to be representative
of what you are indicating.

146
00:08:27.683 --> 00:08:29.500
You are of any other color.

147
00:08:31.073 --> 00:08:35.980
To prepare the character to
animate, we will link all the objects.

148
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.980
Let's start with the most obvious,
which is the face linked to the head,

149
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.940
So when we move the head,
the face moves along with that.

150
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.340
This hair can be linked to the
head and the hair behind as well.

151
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.580
If we move our head, everything
that is linked to it will move.

152
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:55.140
In turn, the head is
linked to the torso,

153
00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:00.260
all the members, arms and
legs, are linked to the torso,

154
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.900
in this case the bag too,

155
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:07.740
and the only thing that remains loose is
the rope, but it is an external object.

156
00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.943
So, if we move the torso ...

157
00:09:11.753 --> 00:09:13.868
We are going to move
the whole character.

158
00:09:15.723 --> 00:09:19.300
We can take the torso
movement as the main guide.

159
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.758
I usually separate the dimensions
because I find it easier to animate them.

160
00:09:23.758 --> 00:09:27.420
We are going to add a keyframe in Y,

161
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.920
because itâ€™s more or less the
final position we want it to reach,

162
00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.400
and we will make it appear from above.

163
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.420
Maybe the legs may
appear a little first ...

164
00:09:40.243 --> 00:09:42.580
and before it appears more from above.

165
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.660
We are going to accelerate this.

166
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.598
I duplicate this keyframe because we
want him to rest there for a moment ...

167
00:09:54.313 --> 00:09:55.663
and maybe something like that.

168
00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.180
For now it's ok.

169
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.180
Let's add detail to this ...

170
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.820
causing the legs to
move independently.

171
00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:10.988
So, this leg may
initially be more flexed.

172
00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:13.980
We are going to select
all the Paths of that layer,

173
00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:15.420
let's put a keyframe

174
00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:19.380
and we will put U to show us
only the animated keyframes.

175
00:10:21.738 --> 00:10:25.900
Now we are going to locate a
new pose for the flexed leg.

176
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:30.540
That's why I'm going to simply
focus on this area of the interface,

177
00:10:31.535 --> 00:10:36.300
Without worrying about time
or anything, it's just a pose.

178
00:10:38.338 --> 00:10:40.940
Sometimes what I do to
have the reference is

179
00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:44.720
look for a pose that seems good to
us, which is what we already have armed,

180
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.760
and with Shift + F5
I capture that pose.

181
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.780
Then we can simply
take F5 as a reference

182
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.580
that captured image and that helps
us to take something as a reference,

183
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.720
without having to
look at the timeline.

184
00:11:01.513 --> 00:11:04.393
This line, when the leg is flexed,

185
00:11:04.393 --> 00:11:05.900
in theory it will disappear

186
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.760
because it is the line that
separates one leg from the other.

187
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:13.200
Then we are going to hide the nodes
so that they practically disappear.

188
00:11:23.525 --> 00:11:26.660
Now the rest is a matter
of polishing the drawing.

189
00:11:37.665 --> 00:11:41.060
This is a very
experimental task, we have to try

190
00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.540
and see what things
work and what doesn't.

191
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.140
Many times we move
forward and make false steps,

192
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:50.700
since maybe we add a movement that does
not produce the effect we are looking for.

193
00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.620
So don't be afraid to move on

194
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.540
without being very sure
of what they are doing.

195
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.180
Let's see how this looks.

196
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.500
There it is slowly taking
shape and gaining expressiveness.

197
00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.060
We will make it fall and we will
give a little bounce to the leg.

198
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.903
We are going to duplicate the frames,
which is the final position we like,

199
00:12:20.903 --> 00:12:24.710
and to the intermediate position we
are going to give it some "stretch".

200
00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.500
With each movement, they should
be careful to update the nodes

201
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.323
so that the form remains consistent.

202
00:12:41.163 --> 00:12:44.900
This is a bit rushed, let's
make it rest a little more there

203
00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.700
and see what happens
if we get those frames,

204
00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:50.180
or we give this a little more time.

205
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.660
Now that we have
more or less advanced,

206
00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.020
we must continue iteratively
with the rest of the other parts

207
00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.180
to gradually add detail,

208
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.948
without needing that
everything we animate is final.

209
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.560
As we add detail,

210
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.180
We will realize what things
are missing and what is not.

211
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.840
We will do something
similar with the other leg,

212
00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:19.788
which in principle is more
hidden, but at this point it appears.

213
00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:27.140
Perhaps, what the leg can
do is a reverse movement.

214
00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.140
Then maybe it appears ...

215
00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:31.660
and then it contracts.

216
00:13:42.658 --> 00:13:47.100
We do all this edition of
nodes with the Arrow tool

217
00:13:47.975 --> 00:13:50.940
or the Pen tool, which is the G,

218
00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:53.133
to modify some kind of thing.

219
00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:58.580
If we press Alt, we
can modify the hands

220
00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.933
and make it have sharp edges.

221
00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.720
Also something I usually use a lot

222
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.460
is to select all the
nodes that we want to move.

223
00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.600
If we double-click any
node of that selection,

224
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.400
we have a transformation chart,
which helps us to rotate, to scale

225
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:17.640
Already do a lot of kind of things,
without having to affect the entire layer.

226
00:14:20.205 --> 00:14:24.180
When we do this kind of
rotations, we should try to keep

227
00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.860
the proportions of each
object that we animate.

228
00:14:33.835 --> 00:14:38.140
Generally in these types of movements,
the important thing is to see the references

229
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:42.940
but, as a general idea, I
have to make the legs usually do

230
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.375
an alternate movement
to maintain balance.

231
00:14:48.185 --> 00:14:52.063
That's why I'm working with
keyframes that go alternately.

232
00:14:52.063 --> 00:14:56.288
Here we are giving a small
bounce and see how it looks.

233
00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:01.620
It is taking shape.

234
00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:05.380
As we add things, this
becomes more organic.
