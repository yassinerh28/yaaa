00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.500
First steps

2
00:00:11.218 --> 00:00:15.420
We can already review some
details, for example, see if this line

3
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.298
that we were using to
separate the legs, is correctly.

4
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.560
For now I think it's fine,

5
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.380
let's see how it looks in
the general composition.

6
00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.940
I think that up to that point is going
well, what we need is that, in a moment,

7
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.620
the rope appears alone
before the character,

8
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.060
This gives us an anticipation
that something will happen there.

9
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.280
For this, we may have
to extend the comp a bit

10
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.280
towards one of the sides, that is,
add a little time at the beginning.

11
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.560
Then I do all this.

12
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.860
Let's take the rope to the beginning.

13
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.980
For now I don't worry much
if it matches the animatic

14
00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:13.008
or with the times we had in mind,
we will adjust them little by little.

15
00:01:21.203 --> 00:01:26.380
For the rope to fall, we will do the
same, which is to animate the Path.

16
00:01:27.865 --> 00:01:30.300
In this case we have two nodes,

17
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.420
so if we want to make
the rope have a curve,

18
00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.980
maybe we are going to
have to add some nodes.

19
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.420
This is better if we do it
in the original form, say,

20
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.460
which in this case
would be the straight.

21
00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.180
So we can anticipate that we
will need nodes to animate the rope.

22
00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.820
In this case, as we know that the rope

23
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.860
it will be animated in a
curved and organic way,

24
00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.140
what we can do is
give it some curvature

25
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.180
to these Bézier nodes,
even if they are straight,

26
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.180
but we'll see why.

27
00:02:07.248 --> 00:02:11.540
If we already gave that
curvature now, when we move the nodes,

28
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.563
It will maintain that
curvature we gave it.

29
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.860
That is going to make him more softly.

30
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.020
In this case I am
doing a little backwards

31
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.900
and having the final
position, which is this,

32
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.060
I'm going to start adding
details to the animation,

33
00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.620
giving a little bounce to the sides.

34
00:02:31.788 --> 00:02:35.458
At the beginning we will
make it fall from above.

35
00:02:47.533 --> 00:02:52.100
When we interpolate
between very large distances,

36
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.980
as here it makes a curve and
then goes to the other end,

37
00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.563
we have to add intermediate frames

38
00:02:58.563 --> 00:03:01.900
I call this when he starts
making almost frame by frame.

39
00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:22.020
Well, it looks pretty good there.

40
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.260
Thanks to the fact that we add
these intermediate keyframes,

41
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.860
the transitions are
now a bit more neat.

42
00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.140
Now we see that every time we extend
this time, it will add more interpolation,

43
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.203
Then maybe it is necessary to
add other intermediate keyframes.

44
00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.820
Let's keep in mind that every
time we add intermediate keyframes,

45
00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.540
the hands of our Bézier nodes
are sometimes reset at an angle.

46
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.300
So, with the Pen and Alt,

47
00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.780
We have to restart them
so that they are straight.

48
00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.860
Let's see how it looks.

49
00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:05.500
It is going well.

50
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.730
We need to lower a
little more and throw.

51
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.353
I am already seeing from the
outset that we are going to lack time.

52
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.180
Let's move this a little over there

53
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.060
and we will continue
adding detail to the character

54
00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.700
the moment he goes down.

55
00:04:33.438 --> 00:04:37.340
We have animated here and now, the
second movement when it comes down

56
00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:43.300
it may have, or starts to
move, a small delay or drag.

57
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.780
I will duplicate these frames and
I will duplicate them at the end

58
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.293
to keep them as a
reference in the ideal position.

59
00:04:52.293 --> 00:04:56.473
And as soon as it starts to
move, we will give it some drag.

60
00:05:09.103 --> 00:05:12.940
When it goes down, instead of more
vertical bouncing than we did recently,

61
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.180
Now I will see if I add
a little more balancing.

62
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.980
It is always important
that, if possible, we add

63
00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.540
what we already saw in
the principles of animation,

64
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.480
A little anticipation, a
little "follow-through"

65
00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.200
"overlapping," or whatever you do

66
00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.700
that gives more
inertia to our movements.

67
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.180
If I eliminate this, I think
it looks a little more fluid.

68
00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.620
What it does is that the
previous final position is connecting me

69
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.100
and start moving
before the body goes down.

70
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.980
Then it is as it gives
a more organic swing,

71
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.740
which helps you gain momentum to
get off, in that case it was fine.

72
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.820
That is what I meant
by trial and error.

73
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.780
There are times that we add
keyframes that in the end we delete

74
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.180
and they look better without it.

75
00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.460
Let's see with this leg if
we will do something similar.

76
00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.020
When I use this transformation box,
I try to move the anchor to the point

77
00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.780
where I imagine the joint is, in
this case it would be the knee,

78
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.020
but not only the tip of the
knee, but the point where I imagine

79
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.700
that match the bones, in
this case it would be there,

80
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:54.860
And we can take as a guide.

81
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:59.460
Imagine that the whole joint is
a circle, something like that,

82
00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.220
according to the shape of our
character, then the center of that circle

83
00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:08.340
It will be approximately where
we will have to locate our joint.

84
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.305
It's going pretty well, but
your feet are too synchronized,

85
00:07:28.305 --> 00:07:30.580
Then I will try to offset this a bit.

86
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.060
I think it's going pretty well.

87
00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.740
We said that, with this
design, we had the problem

88
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.300
that the rope passed
in front of the hand.

89
00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.220
I realize that, at this moment,
it will not represent any problem,

90
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.340
since that part will never be seen.

91
00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.900
Anyway, it's always good to
work the complete designs,

92
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.540
as we did with the
face, in case at some point

93
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.980
we decided to make decisions,

94
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:09.020
that we may have to use
some parts of that design.

95
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.680
Let's see how it goes.

96
00:08:19.038 --> 00:08:20.805
Let's expand this a bit.

97
00:08:31.345 --> 00:08:34.780
It takes a little time to jump.

98
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.778
We are going to add it here
and we will make it match.

99
00:08:37.778 --> 00:08:41.913
Then at the time of jumping,
I imagine that the character

100
00:08:41.913 --> 00:08:45.023
release your hands, that is,
separate them from the rope

101
00:08:45.023 --> 00:08:49.900
and straighten the feet to fall
straight into the final position.

102
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.340
I will expand the work
area a little down and up

103
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.900
to have more vertical space,
above I am not interested but below.

104
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.820
The good thing is that we
continue to maintain the position,

105
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.620
The way in which this character is
located does not alter us at all.

106
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.180
Then we have more work area.

107
00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:14.140
We will locate a
little more advanced in time

108
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.995
the pose we would like
to see of our character.

109
00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:20.700
Let's straighten the legs.

110
00:09:29.463 --> 00:09:34.060
I will do the capture again to
have as a reference, Shift + F5.

111
00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:42.860
This reference helps us to know
if we are conserving the volumes,

112
00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:48.040
which is what we find very
important in this type of animation.

113
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.020
In our design, the
character, having straight legs,

114
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:59.540
you don't notice any knee
or muscle here in the twin,

115
00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.715
then let's turn it all straight.

116
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.060
We will adjust this line and we
will continue with the other leg.

117
00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.140
The moment both legs are stretched,

118
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.933
They must be about the same
length and we adjust that.

119
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.700
We're going to deform the boot a
little and make the cue point down,

120
00:10:56.700 --> 00:10:59.140
to give it more directionality.

121
00:11:14.463 --> 00:11:19.223
Now that the leg is more forward, I
will reduce the perspective of the boot.

122
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.880
Remember that this
is in all the details.

123
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.400
As they correct that
kind of thing ... great.

124
00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:35.780
Also avoid that the Bézier curves
are with the short or straight arms.

125
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.220
For a type of object
that is quite curved,

126
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.540
we have to keep as
long as we can the hands,

127
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:43.540
thus it moves more smoothly.

128
00:11:45.113 --> 00:11:47.180
This is something
more or less similar.

129
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.200
to what would be the
"pose to pose" methodology

130
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:53.940
in traditional animation, in
which we do the keyframes first

131
00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.960
and then the "in-betweens",
"breakdowns" and "in-betweens"

132
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.420
because, in this case,
this would be a keyframe,

133
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.460
although I still think he
has some things to adjust.

134
00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:17.380
This would be the keyframe
and what we have to do now is

135
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.800
do the "breakdowns"
and the "in-between",

136
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.520
that is, the intermediate tables,

137
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.760
that in this case we don't have to do
them because After Effects already made them,

138
00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.060
but we will have to
correct them because many times

139
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.940
the interpolations he does
are not exactly as we want,

140
00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:36.100
We have to add details.

141
00:12:37.193 --> 00:12:41.620
Before that, let's see if
the animation is as we want,

142
00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:46.088
with respect to main poses,
position and that kind of thing.

143
00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:52.780
We are going to cheer up the torso, we
will give a straight acceleration to all this

144
00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:57.140
and we are going to make our
character fall almost to the floor,

145
00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.460
We are going to take
this scene as a reference.

146
00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.740
Let's hide this for now

147
00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.340
Well, time is extending a bit.

148
00:13:07.193 --> 00:13:09.540
We can make it go down maybe there.

149
00:13:10.955 --> 00:13:12.900
I will extend this scene a bit.

150
00:13:15.413 --> 00:13:17.940
Suddenly, our character will fall.

151
00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:20.615
No need to be in
contact with the floor,

152
00:13:20.615 --> 00:13:24.740
because the character will jump and we
want him to have a stronger acceleration.

153
00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.620
Maybe the pose can
be preparing before,

154
00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.850
but we can exaggerate the
vertical movement a bit.

155
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.060
Something like that.

156
00:13:43.858 --> 00:13:46.380
I don't know if everything
should be a little faster.

157
00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:49.460
There goes well.

158
00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:53.580
At the moment we
have our last keyframe,

159
00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.820
let's cut that layer and
let's move on to the next one,

160
00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.860
in which we will work the
transition with this pose.

161
00:14:03.108 --> 00:14:06.420
Something that we are missing
here is the animation of the arms.

162
00:14:07.448 --> 00:14:09.820
Since we don't have
them animated so far,

163
00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.463
we have to add the
keyframes in the Path

164
00:14:13.463 --> 00:14:15.620
and we are going to move all this.

165
00:14:34.593 --> 00:14:38.580
It doesn't have to be perfect because
we will see this picture very quickly,

166
00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:43.140
but we are interested in
seeing that the arms are opening.
