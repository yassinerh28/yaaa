00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.480
First steps

2
00:00:11.103 --> 00:00:14.380
What we are going to try
to correct is this leg line,

3
00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:16.780
which is the separator line,

4
00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.578
It must accompany the
entire shape of the leg.

5
00:00:21.318 --> 00:00:25.580
We are going to have to adjust that
line because we made a very big change.

6
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.520
We are adding intermediate tables.

7
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.660
I think we can exaggerate the
movement of the arms a little more

8
00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.980
To make it more remarkable.

9
00:01:10.573 --> 00:01:12.460
There is pretty good.

10
00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.060
So we are going to continue with this
pose and what we are going to do is,

11
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.580
since we made a new pose for
this drawing as a transition,

12
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.820
We will do the same for this pose.

13
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.980
We will try to
leave this pose as final

14
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:28.980
and we will try to
work on the transition.

15
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.740
We almost see the same
process to sort the layers,

16
00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.900
trying to maintain the same
criteria of names and color.

17
00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:58.100
We put the floor in a
guideline to have reference

18
00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.060
and we continue with the same process.

19
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.460
In this case, as I
calculate that practically

20
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.100
all layers are going to be animated,
I'm going to look for all layers of Path

21
00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.220
of all layers and I will mark
a first keyframe for everyone.

22
00:02:20.398 --> 00:02:25.260
It is a way to save the initial
pose, which in our case will be final,

23
00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:29.913
to be able to animate and
keep that pose without modifying.

24
00:02:32.488 --> 00:02:37.580
Now we are going to make the
character feel like he is falling to the floor

25
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.760
and with some rebound.

26
00:02:45.073 --> 00:02:50.620
As the legs and arms are going
to be supported on the floor,

27
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.740
I don't want them to
be linked to the torso,

28
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:56.060
so I can move the torso
independently of the arms.

29
00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:46.700
I duplicate all the
frames to keep thinking

30
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.673
at the time of rebound.

31
00:04:08.488 --> 00:04:13.140
When we find rare
movements in position animations,

32
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.280
Many times it is because there are
BÃ©zier curves in the positional movement,

33
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.740
especially when we have the
position without separating dimensions.

34
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.340
In this case, since I don't know if
I'm going to move my torso to my sides,

35
00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.500
I'm going to leave the united position

36
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.180
but I'm going to make
my keyframe interpolation

37
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.180
in spatial mode be linear.

38
00:05:02.203 --> 00:05:04.940
I will carry all these
keyframes at the beginning.

39
00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.058
Now that we have a basic
animation, let's see how it is moving.

40
00:05:17.988 --> 00:05:20.540
It's pretty good but
there's still a lot left.

41
00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.920
I think, above all, this
has to be very fast at first.

42
00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.300
Maybe at this moment when it goes
down, we should exaggerate a little more

43
00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.500
the vertical movement, thus
connecting the two poses better.

44
00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.053
In this case, when we see that
the comp is trimming the content,

45
00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:47.420
if we know that we
have all vector inside,

46
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.780
we can apply the star and we know
that everything will be represented

47
00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.153
as if it were within this comp.

48
00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:56.338
So there the limits don't matter.

49
00:05:56.338 --> 00:05:59.340
We could also extend
the comp as we did before

50
00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.980
But, in this case, this
solution is simpler and works for now.

51
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.548
I'll go down a little more, to the
point where I almost touched the floor.

52
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.220
I'm going to take this
character a little further to the left

53
00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:17.860
so that the feet
match a little better.

54
00:06:20.718 --> 00:06:22.700
There you can see
everything more connected.

55
00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.180
This helps us to see that
it is not always necessary

56
00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.823
make complete transitions,

57
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.360
as I spoke at the beginning of the
course with the theme of "timing",

58
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.240
but simply to make
transitions between poses,

59
00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.758
and it's basically giving it a very
fast acceleration, only we don't see it.

60
00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:44.900
This is more or less
good, now I'm noticing

61
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.340
that the rope is disappearing, then
I'm going to look for that composition,

62
00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:53.945
I am going to duplicate it and I am
going to make one that is Solo_came.

63
00:06:57.148 --> 00:07:00.020
Then I delete
everything, except the rope,

64
00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:02.660
and we have a
composition with the animated rope.

65
00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:05.140
Then we can...

66
00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:10.460
put that composition inside it.

67
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.340
We put Guide and
remove the original rope.

68
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.300
We only add that layer so
that it exists as a reference

69
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.140
but, really, it is
not important to add it.

70
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.540
The good thing about now is that
we have the rope in a separate layer

71
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.540
and we can extend it to the end.

72
00:07:31.283 --> 00:07:33.660
Now we need to improve
this animation a bit,

73
00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:38.660
adding details on the
hair, hands and other things.

74
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.708
I will also see if I take the
opportunity to give a little drag to the hair

75
00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:44.580
when the character is falling

76
00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.568
When the object has
a downward movement,

77
00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:30.020
the drag is done simulating
that the object is going up,

78
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.940
then compensates with the
direction in which it moves

79
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.140
and seems to have some resistance.

80
00:08:36.668 --> 00:08:38.820
Now the hair comes from the right,

81
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:42.010
Then you have to pretend
that this movement continues.

82
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:47.260
The movement is just an illusion
that is given by a sequence of images,

83
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.580
That is basically what we are doing.

84
00:09:47.723 --> 00:09:49.905
We will do the same with the bag.

85
00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:55.140
With every little detail,
we always add some animation.

86
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.220
In this case the bag
works like an appendix,

87
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.423
It is like something that is
added to the main object that moves.

88
00:10:02.423 --> 00:10:06.580
So that's why it has a
small delay in movements.

89
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.020
Here I am encountering the problem

90
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:45.028
that the nodes, having a
straight line formation,

91
00:10:45.028 --> 00:10:48.210
when we want to make
curved or rotating movements,

92
00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:51.903
our object changes scale,
so we have to correct that.

93
00:11:16.353 --> 00:11:18.940
We are correcting details as we can.

94
00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.020
We are going to give the torso a bit
of rotation and this is going to do

95
00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.580
that all objects that are
depending on him, such as the head,

96
00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.100
They are also affected.

97
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.940
Ideally I would have put the
torso anchor at a more logical point,

98
00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:54.060
like at the waist, but it
shouldn't be too much trouble either

99
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.473
if we adjust the
position, along with the rotation.

100
00:13:14.983 --> 00:13:19.140
With all these movements, we
give it a little more naturalness.

101
00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.820
Then it's a matter of
adjusting when we see problems,

102
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.260
for example, here.

103
00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.980
We are adjusting the pose
of the hand, in this case,

104
00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.540
and how I want only the
hand, and not the whole arm,

105
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.860
continue with that pose up to that
point, sometimes what I do is select

106
00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:05.093
all the nodes of the objects
that I want to continue animating

107
00:14:05.093 --> 00:14:08.580
and, by moving them, I see
where the keyframes are generated

108
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.500
because if not, we have
a list of unnamed Paths.

109
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.123
By doing this, we can
detect what the keyframes are

110
00:14:15.123 --> 00:14:17.978
We need to keep cheering.

111
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.020
Finally I will give a
little bounce to the head.

112
00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.940
Care must be taken that it does not
appear that objects are expanding.

113
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.420
Here the neck seemed
to be getting longer.

114
00:15:06.485 --> 00:15:10.500
With that, I think we
can end this first stage.

115
00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.920
As I mentioned at the
beginning, we can add an adjustment layer

116
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.080
Have a Posterize Time and
see how it looks at twelve.

117
00:15:30.193 --> 00:15:33.700
I quite like the effect that
is generated and, in this case,

118
00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.065
It is showing us just all the
keyframes that are important.

119
00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:43.380
Sometimes, for example,
maybe just this contact keyframe

120
00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.500
He's not showing it
because he skips it

121
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:50.603
so let's adjust the
Rate and animate it,

122
00:15:50.603 --> 00:15:53.300
so that in the
fastest moment of action,

123
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:56.900
let's have 24
keyframes and then back to 12.

124
00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:04.860
The times need to be adjusted.

125
00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:11.688
So we have our first
scene practically ready.

126
00:16:21.345 --> 00:16:23.660
We already took our first steps

127
00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:26.260
and now we can
continue with the next scene.
