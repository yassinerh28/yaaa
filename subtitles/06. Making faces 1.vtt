00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.480
Making faces

2
00:00:09.153 --> 00:00:13.193
In this lesson we will animate
the approach to the face scene,

3
00:00:13.193 --> 00:00:16.238
where we will focus on
the character's expressions.

4
00:00:21.808 --> 00:00:25.523
In the previous scene I added
a last move to the character,

5
00:00:25.523 --> 00:00:27.360
in which he begins to stand.

6
00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:29.723
So, the moment we make the cut,

7
00:00:29.723 --> 00:00:32.373
We can continue the
movement with this scene.

8
00:00:32.578 --> 00:00:36.012
This kind of thing helps us
connect one scene with another

9
00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:39.913
and at the same time it simplifies us
not having to show the complete movement

10
00:00:39.913 --> 00:00:41.030
of the character.

11
00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.540
I followed the process we had been
using to encourage the character,

12
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.693
animated with vector layers, with
changes of position and rotation.

13
00:00:48.693 --> 00:00:51.995
What I did keep in mind is
that the movement of the character

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.600
when standing it is
different from when it falls.

15
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.000
Deal with the torso, raising the
shoulders first and then the head.

16
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.040
I made the cut right then,

17
00:01:02.045 --> 00:01:04.668
so when we follow it
with the next scene

18
00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.485
We can make the
character appear on the floor.

19
00:01:08.383 --> 00:01:12.445
Let's do the usual, and
convert our layers to vectors.

20
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.007
Luckily, the Illustrator
file was interpreted perfectly,

21
00:01:27.007 --> 00:01:31.163
even on the face where we have a
clipping mask applied to the eye.

22
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.548
Now we are going to
link the Path of the mask

23
00:01:36.548 --> 00:01:40.125
with the white part of the
eye, just to have to animate one.

24
00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:57.328
Now what we can do is
animate the pupil figure

25
00:01:57.328 --> 00:02:00.208
and it will be perfectly masked

26
00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:03.560
and when we move the white
part the mask will move too.

27
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.720
We will do the same
with the other eye.

28
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.463
This should be achieved in order
to perfectly animate all objects.

29
00:02:23.463 --> 00:02:26.028
We will do the same with
the other side of the face.

30
00:02:40.038 --> 00:02:42.165
Now we focus on animation.

31
00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:46.530
Let's go to the beginning,
let's give it a position keyframe

32
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.155
to all objects and
one of rotation to all.

33
00:02:49.223 --> 00:02:51.387
And we will select all Paths,

34
00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:56.213
except those with the duplicate
expression, and we add a keyframe.

35
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.275
First we create a null, which
we will link to our character

36
00:03:15.275 --> 00:03:19.938
to make our character appear
from the bottom of the scene.

37
00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:44.555
The character does not
have to disappear completely,

38
00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:47.335
better if you don't,
because at the time of the cut

39
00:03:47.335 --> 00:03:50.662
The character is already on the
move, is already in transition.

40
00:03:55.353 --> 00:03:57.642
Let's give a little overlapping here.

41
00:04:12.858 --> 00:04:15.785
For now we leave aside
the animation of the null,

42
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.200
to focus on a false
face rotation movement,

43
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.600
So then we combine both
movements for a sense of dimensionality.

44
00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.360
If you stand in front of the
mirror and look at your head

45
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.480
making a "yes" movement, up and down,

46
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.320
you will see that when the head
lowers the front of the face also lowers

47
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.218
but the ears and the
back of the hair go up.

48
00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:12.858
That's because the axis of the
face is quite centered on the skull

49
00:05:12.858 --> 00:05:16.155
and the parts that are farthest

50
00:05:16.155 --> 00:05:19.198
they move in the opposite
direction to those that are closer.

51
00:05:19.198 --> 00:05:22.605
That we try to simulate
when we make a face move.

52
00:05:53.183 --> 00:05:56.355
Let's take advantage that we
can deform the face completely

53
00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.640
and we're going to fine tune the
jaw when you look straight ahead

54
00:05:59.645 --> 00:06:02.300
since it is as if
we saw it from above.

55
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.275
This part of the hair will be
like a jopo, it becomes more round

56
00:06:13.275 --> 00:06:15.113
when leaning forward.

57
00:06:18.313 --> 00:06:21.333
There more or less we
have a sense of rotation.

58
00:06:21.563 --> 00:06:25.330
We have to consider that the
head, having the axis in the neck,

59
00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.250
when leaning you should move forward.

60
00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.793
If not, it seems that the
face is going backwards.

61
00:07:01.893 --> 00:07:05.118
Once we are happy with
the movement of the face,

62
00:07:05.118 --> 00:07:08.460
We can accommodate other parts
of the body, such as the torso.

63
00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.857
For now, keyframes have
a linear acceleration.

64
00:07:17.857 --> 00:07:22.098
It is better to ensure a good
movement of all the elements accordingly

65
00:07:22.098 --> 00:07:24.325
before applying acceleration.

66
00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.080
The torso could be
forward, as if inclined.

67
00:07:40.858 --> 00:07:45.015
And we can give it some
rotation to exaggerate the movement.

68
00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.440
There is good. Now we lack hair.

69
00:07:52.583 --> 00:07:55.260
We are going to place it
more or less where it belongs.

70
00:07:55.903 --> 00:07:58.550
And we reconnect
everything with the null.

71
00:07:58.783 --> 00:08:01.963
Let's not change the
things we already have linked,

72
00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:04.635
but only link those
that are not linked.

73
00:08:04.798 --> 00:08:07.563
If we link the torso and
the hair, and the others,

74
00:08:07.563 --> 00:08:11.278
being linked to it, they
will be linked in a chain.

75
00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:23.295
Now we have to work on acceleration.

76
00:08:31.338 --> 00:08:33.833
We give it a very smooth deceleration.

77
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.160
There we see that by
linking the two movements

78
00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:53.205
We already have a simulation
of that volumetric movement.

79
00:08:53.418 --> 00:08:56.143
Maybe we can tilt
our face a little more.

80
00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:15.268
Remember that sometimes
when adding new keyframes,

81
00:09:15.268 --> 00:09:18.718
If that position was not
animated, it will generate new curves.

82
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:32.488
We will continue to encourage the
hair to give it a little more life.

83
00:10:13.128 --> 00:10:15.760
Let's give it a little bounce up

84
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.643
and for the opposite
side from which we come.

85
00:10:32.123 --> 00:10:34.990
We can make it come a little lower.

86
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.758
There is a little more exaggerated.

87
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:43.960
Let's see how the transition works.

88
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.537
Well, pretty good.
