00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.500
Making faces

2
00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:14.020
Now let's cheer up your face a
little to give it expressiveness.

3
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.600
Now let's see if we can make it blink.

4
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.080
We are going to move all the nodes of
the eye, except those of the pupil ...

5
00:01:11.635 --> 00:01:13.980
until we have just one line left.

6
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.660
We must try to make all the
poses we encourage look good.

7
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.540
In the event that our
character is blinking,

8
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.980
we must try to make
that drawing look good,

9
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.940
beyond whether it
will look fast or not,

10
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.020
because generally that animation
is something that goes very fast.

11
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.700
We must try to make it work well.

12
00:02:19.178 --> 00:02:21.900
The moment the eyes open,

13
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.148
we can enlarge the shape of the
eye a little, a little down ...

14
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.163
and this, which
would be like eyelashes,

15
00:02:32.185 --> 00:02:33.500
A little up.

16
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.620
This will give you a small
bounce when you open your eyes.

17
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.180
Let's make it very short.

18
00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.620
Finally the movement in
which it closes has to be shorter

19
00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.440
than in the one that opens.

20
00:02:55.288 --> 00:02:58.380
There it went well and then
we have to in a single frame,

21
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.860
the eyes close, then I
doubled the keyframes

22
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.900
to keep them closed,
they open in two frames,

23
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.100
those who have an
acceleration towards the end

24
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.580
and, when they open,
they open a little more

25
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.140
then rest in its final
state with a small bounce.

26
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.460
Let's see how this looks on the scene.

27
00:03:21.045 --> 00:03:22.540
I think it's pretty good.

28
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.580
The hair could have a
little more customization,

29
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.610
I played a little with
the scale and it shows.

30
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.540
It's good when that kind
of object comes organic,

31
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.140
We are working them frame by
frame, not so much using scale tools.

32
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.980
For now we will leave it like this

33
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.143
and we will continue with the
movement of one face towards the other.

34
00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:48.980
When we are going to animate a turn of the
head, the normal thing is that our character

35
00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.220
look a little down and close your eyes

36
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.300
in the movement where the head turns.

37
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.980
Then we will do that.

38
00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.220
With this pose, we will
reach a midpoint of transition

39
00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.180
and then we will
continue with these layers.

40
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.260
So now we are going to select all
the keyframes that we have animated

41
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.460
and we place a new one so that
everyone starts moving from there.

42
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.020
Let's generate the new pose,

43
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.460
which is a bit looking down
and with your eyes closed.

44
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:23.140
The ear is going to
be almost straight,

45
00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.335
so, perhaps, almost not even seen.

46
00:04:29.723 --> 00:04:34.540
We are going to take the head to a
way that is as frontal as we can.

47
00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.180
For now we will not consider
communication with the torso,

48
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.820
We are simply going
to make a head head.

49
00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.785
Now the face, we will
have to deform it completely

50
00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:08.340
because we are going to
simulate the curvature it has.

51
00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:38.180
The nose will become almost frontal.

52
00:05:42.563 --> 00:05:45.380
The pupil will look
straight ahead and slightly down.

53
00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.660
The mouth actually has
to straighten a little.

54
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.100
This we had, which was
like the lip behind it,

55
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.140
It has to line up.

56
00:06:05.993 --> 00:06:08.825
There we know that it gives
us the feeling of rotation

57
00:06:08.825 --> 00:06:12.500
but, at the same time, we are
going to make our character blink.

58
00:06:29.933 --> 00:06:33.260
I will try to make both
eyes as symmetrical as I can,

59
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.420
although they are
not exactly the same.

60
00:06:39.128 --> 00:06:42.020
Meanwhile, we will
correct the hair a bit.

61
00:06:56.008 --> 00:06:57.980
The face will fall in a moment

62
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:01.500
and the head, with his
chin and everything, too.

63
00:07:13.445 --> 00:07:16.140
We will take all
accelerations to linear,

64
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.620
since it is the midpoint of
transition between one pose and another.

65
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.300
When the face leans forward, the
things that stand out the most,

66
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.980
like the nose, it has
to go down a little more

67
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.660
and the mouth can go up a
bit to counteract that movement

68
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.980
and give it a little more depth.

69
00:07:53.668 --> 00:07:56.180
The ear will disappear completely.

70
00:08:03.363 --> 00:08:05.900
It's going well but it
was a bit off center.

71
00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:09.733
Let's keep making the effort to
keep it a bit more symmetrical.

72
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.260
We can't make the ear disappear
completely because it has that stroke,

73
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:26.260
We can find the group of the ear
and apply an opacity to the stroke.

74
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:29.060
We do it very short so
you don't notice a "fade"

75
00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:32.743
but, so that at the moment where it
is closed, the ear does not exist.

76
00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:39.080
Now we have to accommodate this.

77
00:08:44.118 --> 00:08:47.260
I think we can lower
our heads a little more.

78
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:58.060
For now it's fine, we're going
to play with the accelerations

79
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.580
when we have the other
half of the animation.

80
00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.020
With this part of the
face, we will do the same

81
00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.013
but in the opposite
direction, we will end with this pose

82
00:09:07.013 --> 00:09:10.660
and the first one I
will do will be centered.

83
00:11:14.688 --> 00:11:17.998
To the eyebrows we want to
give an expression of surprise,

84
00:11:17.998 --> 00:11:19.860
let's make them appear

85
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.620
with a little more
concentration at the beginning,

86
00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.060
so then they rise more strongly.

87
00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:45.180
There is good.
