00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.480
Making faces

2
00:00:10.523 --> 00:00:14.533
Now we must make these two
poses, which are supposedly the same,

3
00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.545
be as similar as possible.

4
00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:28.703
I will try to give that
feeling of inclination of the face.

5
00:00:32.603 --> 00:00:34.973
The head has to lower much more.

6
00:00:37.618 --> 00:00:40.590
We are going to throw a
guideline to make sure

7
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.932
that the two poses of the
faces coincide horizontally.

8
00:01:02.953 --> 00:01:06.310
There is pretty good, we
can eliminate the guidelines.

9
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.908
Let's cheer up the
torso a little more.

10
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.425
We will move the torso to the
right when it starts to move.

11
00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.090
And what we are
going to do in this case

12
00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.132
It is to maintain a
single torso for everything.

13
00:02:37.943 --> 00:02:41.488
We are going to change this
place, so we can stretch this image,

14
00:02:41.938 --> 00:02:45.505
and it's the one we're going
to use for our second pose too.

15
00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:48.818
We will take as
reference the one below,

16
00:02:48.818 --> 00:02:51.763
since it is the design
that we initially thought

17
00:02:51.763 --> 00:02:55.710
and we are going to adapt
this layer to that design.

18
00:02:55.778 --> 00:02:57.868
Using Difference layer mode,

19
00:02:57.868 --> 00:03:01.427
I can help myself locate
things where they have to go.

20
00:03:03.448 --> 00:03:06.853
Since the torso will be the one
with the most continuous movement,

21
00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.850
We want it to be a single layer.

22
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.428
It will avoid problems,

23
00:03:10.428 --> 00:03:13.558
and we will make sure
that it moves smoothly.

24
00:03:24.198 --> 00:03:25.453
It is almost there.

25
00:03:25.453 --> 00:03:29.320
What I think he needs is to play
a little with the accelerations.

26
00:03:29.703 --> 00:03:31.793
Let's give it a little more time

27
00:03:31.793 --> 00:03:33.580
at the moment he blinks.

28
00:03:39.443 --> 00:03:42.595
And let's give this
pose a bit of Overlapping.

29
00:03:49.508 --> 00:03:52.965
I'm going to add a keyframe
to everyone we have animated.

30
00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:01.180
And I'm going to
exaggerate this pose a little,

31
00:04:03.463 --> 00:04:05.253
opening your eyes a little more.

32
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.920
And this is going to give an
acceleration with Ease In, but make it fast.

33
00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.413
We are going to give a
little bounce to the head.

34
00:04:45.143 --> 00:04:50.598
I make sure that all positions
have a linear spatial interpolation,

35
00:04:50.598 --> 00:04:53.572
so they don't surprise
us with strange movements.

36
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.383
Something like that, very
soft, should already be fine.

37
00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:44.682
There it was pretty good, the only
thing that looks weird is the hair

38
00:05:44.682 --> 00:05:46.680
because we haven't encouraged him yet.

39
00:05:47.233 --> 00:05:50.080
With the hair we will do
the same as with the torso.

40
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.047
Let's leave the one
below for reference.

41
00:05:55.893 --> 00:05:58.425
I put Difference as layer mode

42
00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:00.598
and I make sure that
in the final position

43
00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.720
look as we had
designed in our styleframe.

44
00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:22.453
There it is more or less.

45
00:06:22.453 --> 00:06:25.283
The colors are very
crazy with this layer mode.

46
00:06:25.283 --> 00:06:28.008
We could change the
idea of it being a zombie.

47
00:06:28.008 --> 00:06:29.953
We carry our hair behind everything

48
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.440
and we will continue
tying the keyframes.

49
00:07:02.718 --> 00:07:06.063
First, as a basis, I make
sure the times are fine,

50
00:07:06.063 --> 00:07:09.595
and that the movement follow
the movement made by the head.

51
00:07:20.925 --> 00:07:23.153
There we can give it a little bounce.

52
00:07:48.593 --> 00:07:51.228
Once we made all the
necessary adjustments

53
00:07:51.228 --> 00:07:53.680
and we gave
expressiveness to the hair, we can give

54
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.000
The head animation is over.

55
00:07:56.868 --> 00:08:00.538
What we will do now is that the
face looks back to the other side,

56
00:08:00.538 --> 00:08:03.393
because we are going to
cut with the diamond scene

57
00:08:03.393 --> 00:08:05.220
which is on our left.

58
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.680
If we end the character
scene looking to the right,

59
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.120
We will think that the
diamond is on the right.

60
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.543
And that is not like that.

61
00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:16.583
So, we can take advantage that we
already have this transition made

62
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.720
and do the same, but inverted.

63
00:09:23.053 --> 00:09:25.988
Finally, we are going
to add a camera movement

64
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.440
That ends with a very high
speed to connect to the next scene.

65
00:10:04.998 --> 00:10:08.735
Anyway, this kind of
resources to reverse the layers

66
00:10:08.735 --> 00:10:11.952
I recommend that they use it
only when they are short of time.

67
00:10:11.952 --> 00:10:15.242
I didn't want to extend
much with this, so I wanted

68
00:10:15.242 --> 00:10:17.140
Recycle what we had already done.

69
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.322
But if they have time to
do it by hand, the better.

70
00:10:21.368 --> 00:10:24.603
Finally, we can
finish this scene by adding

71
00:10:24.603 --> 00:10:28.633
all camera movements and the
rest of the remaining animations,

72
00:10:28.633 --> 00:10:31.635
Like the sparkle of the diamond

73
00:11:57.888 --> 00:12:00.515
We are already moving a
little further with our animation.

74
00:12:00.515 --> 00:12:03.670
Now we can move on to the next scene.
