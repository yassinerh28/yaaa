1
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.423
Action

2
00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:13.053
In this lesson we will continue with
the scene of more action of our animation.

3
00:00:13.053 --> 00:00:16.558
We will encourage the
fastest movements of our character.

4
00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:20.918
We will see what Smear frames are
and how to apply them in After Effects.

5
00:00:25.753 --> 00:00:27.935
We are going to
continue taking the boot,

6
00:00:27.935 --> 00:00:31.075
which is what will give
rise to the next scene.

7
00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:35.343
It will serve us in
anticipation for the next action.

8
00:00:35.645 --> 00:00:39.650
We will take as a reference the
moment in which according to our animatic

9
00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.403
the next scene begins,

10
00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:43.865
to put a mark on our composition,

11
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.760
just to have the
references, insurance lasts longer.

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.200
Let's go to the boot
comp, to cheer her up.

13
00:00:51.178 --> 00:00:54.670
We only have one layer
in our precomposition

14
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.602
isolated from the bottom
then it doesn't make much sense

15
00:00:57.602 --> 00:00:59.920
Work it on a separate precomp.

16
00:01:00.303 --> 00:01:04.080
So what we are going to do is
get the contents of that precomp.

17
00:01:04.253 --> 00:01:06.713
I will do this with
the help of a plugin.

18
00:01:06.713 --> 00:01:09.977
Yes, I told them we wouldn't use
plugins but this one doesn't count,

19
00:01:09.977 --> 00:01:12.297
Because it is very
simple and very useful.

20
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.675
It's called Un-PreCompose,
I'll give you the link to use it.

21
00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:18.533
What it does is extract
the content of the precomp.

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.203
We give OK to the options.

23
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.838
We removed the boot layer
in the exact position it had,

24
00:01:24.838 --> 00:01:27.865
with all the
animations I would have had,

25
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.032
having had, something as it was.

26
00:01:30.032 --> 00:01:32.753
And we add this null in
case the precomposition

27
00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:36.130
I had some position, in this
case not so we eliminated it.

28
00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.823
All we wanted was to remove the boot.

29
00:01:40.288 --> 00:01:44.120
Let's do as always,
convert to vector layer.

30
00:01:46.348 --> 00:01:48.045
And let's start cheering.

31
00:01:48.045 --> 00:01:53.733
I will locate the anchor
point at the heel point.

32
00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:57.795
Just in case, if at any
time we perform a rotation,

33
00:01:57.795 --> 00:02:00.600
That will be our point
of contact with the floor.

34
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.648
First we are going to
add a position keyframe.

35
00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:06.295
And another rotation.

36
00:02:07.038 --> 00:02:11.822
With the keyboard shortcuts, with P and
R, the rotation and position are shown,

37
00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.520
they should know that, but once they
have the position they press Shift + R

38
00:02:16.538 --> 00:02:18.120
Show the two together.

39
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.593
In this shot we can
play a little over time,

40
00:02:23.593 --> 00:02:27.625
in the sense of slow
motion in a moment.

41
00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:32.673
Then we will make the
foot appear quickly,

42
00:02:32.673 --> 00:02:36.643
maybe he stays there for a
while, maybe when he's stepping on,

43
00:02:38.268 --> 00:02:39.988
and finally walks away.

44
00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:44.398
Here the first
moment can be very fast.

45
00:02:46.093 --> 00:02:49.360
And the slow moment may be
when it is about to gain momentum.

46
00:02:57.145 --> 00:03:01.408
In general I try to use
position and rotation animations.

47
00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:03.662
Thus our object does not deform much,

48
00:03:03.948 --> 00:03:07.038
and we can move it
through space more easily.

49
00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:11.658
Once we have the basic
structure of the movement,

50
00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:15.173
Let's start
adjusting the famous Paths.

51
00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:20.465
I will locate the first
keyframes at the moment we define

52
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.280
in our styleframe,
which is this moment.

53
00:03:23.593 --> 00:03:27.610
Here we know that all those keyframes
are fine and we will leave them like this.

54
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.090
Now we are going to start modifying
them to adapt them to each position.

55
00:03:36.548 --> 00:03:39.757
Keep in mind that when
you have a rotated object,

56
00:03:40.078 --> 00:03:43.375
if they use the transformation
box and move it with the keyboard

57
00:03:43.375 --> 00:03:47.278
it will move in the direction
in which the object is rotated.

58
00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:49.343
That can be a bit confusing.

59
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.960
In these cases, perhaps it is
better to simply use the "mouse".

60
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.640
Or the tablet.

61
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.508
This is the moment we have

62
00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:07.280
the foot fully supported on the
floor, which is the moment when recharging

63
00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.953
energy, say, and then boost.

64
00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:19.363
In this moment in which
the foot remains still,

65
00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:22.302
What we will do is make it flex.

66
00:04:22.338 --> 00:04:25.750
When we're more or
less happy with a pose,

67
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.248
we can add keyframes in all Paths,

68
00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:32.718
even those who are not animated yet,
and if we encourage them in the next pose

69
00:04:32.718 --> 00:04:37.133
We are going to want to be encouraged
from this keyframe, not from the beginning.

70
00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:40.880
We put a kind of
"checkpoint", a stop at that time,

71
00:04:40.888 --> 00:04:43.793
to make sure that position is fixed.

72
00:04:46.208 --> 00:04:48.705
Now let's see how we flex this.

73
00:04:57.238 --> 00:04:59.642
Here we are going to
have an interpolation

74
00:04:59.642 --> 00:05:03.043
a little weird, we may have to
correct something very subtle,

75
00:05:03.043 --> 00:05:08.060
but there are some slightly
rare deformations in between.

76
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.798
We are going to adjust
these details at the end.

77
00:05:26.888 --> 00:05:30.153
But as long as we can fix
some things, the better.

78
00:05:37.198 --> 00:05:41.912
This is the moment when you
can slow everything down a bit.

79
00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.787
And the final moment will be faster.

80
00:05:59.118 --> 00:06:01.445
Now, when the boot starts to take off,

81
00:06:01.445 --> 00:06:05.078
we will adjust the shape

82
00:06:05.078 --> 00:06:07.688
as if it were peeling off the floor.

83
00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:20.433
When making deformations so linked
to another object, such as the floor,

84
00:06:20.433 --> 00:06:23.148
and they are in the middle
of a position transition,

85
00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:26.040
what we can do is
also fix a keyframe there

86
00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:29.163
so that later we can move
those two attributes together,

87
00:06:29.163 --> 00:06:31.527
those of the form and
those of the position.

88
00:06:31.948 --> 00:06:34.108
We can adjust the time a bit,

89
00:06:34.108 --> 00:06:38.365
making sure that he will keep in
touch with the floor, as we wanted.

90
00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:52.615
And at this moment when it is
already taking off from the floor,

91
00:06:52.615 --> 00:06:55.883
let's make it
stretch as much as possible

92
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.880
So you feel like you
are giving momentum.

93
00:07:06.035 --> 00:07:08.498
There it was pretty
good, but right now

94
00:07:08.498 --> 00:07:11.470
It feels like it warps a little.

95
00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.843
We have to start
taking care of the volumes.

96
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.480
Something like that
is already pretty good.

97
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.308
Let's see if at this moment,
when the foot is about to support,

98
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.395
we can soften this rotation a bit

99
00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.120
and give the toe a little delay,

100
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.200
that in this case,
actually, instead of giving it delay

101
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.638
Let's anticipate all this part.

102
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.278
That already starts to be in position

103
00:07:43.278 --> 00:07:46.345
and finally lower
only the tip of the foot.

104
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.242
This scene with this
should have been pretty good.
