1
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.423
Action

2
00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:13.378
Many times, when we
think an animation is ready

3
00:00:13.378 --> 00:00:18.370
We see her again later and there are
details that can be corrected or improved.

4
00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.807
That is why I will show you details
that I adjusted in this camera shot

5
00:00:22.807 --> 00:00:24.568
to take them into account.

6
00:00:24.568 --> 00:00:28.655
First I adjusted the time a
little by shortening the first movement

7
00:00:28.655 --> 00:00:32.580
so that they are only three
frames to make it very impressive.

8
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.363
I left space at the beginning
before entering the boot in the shot,

9
00:00:38.363 --> 00:00:41.905
and I adjusted the end time
also so that it comes out faster.

10
00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:46.838
Then I added some
secondary action to the strings

11
00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.723
to give them a little bounce,

12
00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.690
which is very subtle
but adds a little life.

13
00:00:51.783 --> 00:00:54.338
Finally, the Posterize layer

14
00:00:54.338 --> 00:00:57.658
where I pass some parts of
the animation to 12 frames.

15
00:00:58.028 --> 00:01:01.587
Here we see the curve where
I left the first part in 24

16
00:01:01.587 --> 00:01:06.498
to see all the movements of
the first frame, which is fast,

17
00:01:06.528 --> 00:01:08.175
and once he makes contact

18
00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:11.080
I passed it to 12 to
limit this animation a bit.

19
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.178
Finally, I returned to 24 at
the time the boot is removed.

20
00:01:15.178 --> 00:01:17.903
And so time was a little tighter

21
00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:20.788
and the boot movement
a little bit more neat.

22
00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.148
Now we go with the next shot,
which is this one of the pirouette.

23
00:01:25.148 --> 00:01:30.950
This shot presents a very big challenge,
that of bringing this pose to the standing pose.

24
00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:35.388
For that, first we are going to
unlink our layers of the camera null

25
00:01:35.388 --> 00:01:39.358
so as not to worry about the
horizontal camera movement for now.

26
00:01:39.523 --> 00:01:42.750
We will simply carry a pose
from one place to another.

27
00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:48.855
When we meet an instance
in which we face a challenge

28
00:01:48.855 --> 00:01:50.133
here of the animation,

29
00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.943
we can go back to the drawing

30
00:01:51.943 --> 00:01:57.078
to generate references that serve as
an intermediate for the transition.

31
00:01:57.353 --> 00:02:00.583
In this case, what I did
was, back in Photoshop,

32
00:02:00.583 --> 00:02:03.183
open the sketches of our poses

33
00:02:03.183 --> 00:02:06.440
and I left the two poses that
we already have as a reference.

34
00:02:06.618 --> 00:02:10.562
Then I started to sketch some
ideas of how the transition can be.

35
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.770
I also did this with
the help of a reference,

36
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.502
I searched online for "aerial cartwheel",
which would be like this kind of pirouette

37
00:02:19.502 --> 00:02:22.320
which is not exactly
what we are going to do

38
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.843
but it serves me equally as a
reference to see how the legs move.

39
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.390
Our pirouette, being a pretty
fancy animation, so to speak,

40
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.343
It's not a very real pirouette,

41
00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:38.787
then we don't need to rely on a
movement that is too realistic

42
00:02:38.787 --> 00:02:42.818
but it still helps us understand how to
move things from one place to another.

43
00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:47.508
In this case, it helped me to
understand that at the time of final support

44
00:02:47.508 --> 00:02:51.478
First one leg is fully
supported while the other is opposite.

45
00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:54.915
I figured that in the
transition between these two poses

46
00:02:54.915 --> 00:02:58.768
the intermediate position can be in
which one foot is already going down

47
00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:02.350
to lean on the floor while
the other is still straight.

48
00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:05.585
Finally I added a very easy pose,

49
00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.533
the moment when the
character leans on the floor.

50
00:03:08.533 --> 00:03:11.358
It would be like a kind of
Overlapping, or Overshoot,

51
00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:14.587
let's say, where the character,
with all the strength that comes,

52
00:03:14.587 --> 00:03:18.197
You have to sit on the floor
for a moment and then stand up.

53
00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.968
I just flexed my legs.

54
00:03:19.968 --> 00:03:24.595
For now, I think that with these two
poses we already have at least one idea

55
00:03:24.595 --> 00:03:26.960
of how we are going
to move our character.

56
00:03:27.143 --> 00:03:30.148
In this instance where
we make support drawings,

57
00:03:30.148 --> 00:03:33.575
the sketches can be even more sloppy

58
00:03:33.575 --> 00:03:37.168
that at the beginning, because
we are simply helping each other

59
00:03:37.168 --> 00:03:39.772
Get an idea of how to locate things.

60
00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:43.468
It is not necessarily a
figure that we are going to copy.

61
00:03:43.468 --> 00:03:47.353
So just drawing some
lines should be enough.

62
00:03:47.668 --> 00:03:51.545
I'm going to export this just
for reference in After Effects.

63
00:03:52.173 --> 00:03:57.305
Already in After Effects, I imported
the image we just exported from Photoshop

64
00:03:57.305 --> 00:04:02.158
and we place it where it has to go
and we will have it as a reference.

65
00:04:02.645 --> 00:04:04.328
So it is a guiding layer.

66
00:04:05.338 --> 00:04:08.038
Let's leave it
there, very transparent,

67
00:04:08.038 --> 00:04:11.260
because it is a reference
that has to be very smooth.

68
00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:15.255
And we will start with the
animation of the pirouette.

69
00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:18.133
In this case, again we will extract

70
00:04:18.133 --> 00:04:20.525
all layers of our pose,

71
00:04:20.525 --> 00:04:25.175
since in this precomp they are
bottomless and without much reference.

72
00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:28.745
We will use the
Un-PreCompose plugin again.

73
00:04:29.488 --> 00:04:31.393
And we will extract the layers.

74
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.800
We remove the
Controller, which is not necessary,

75
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.500
and we have our
character in these three layers.

76
00:04:38.543 --> 00:04:43.073
Again we convert it to a vector,
luckily this time they are few layers.

77
00:04:51.173 --> 00:04:53.868
This for now we
eliminate, not to confuse.

78
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.118
Here we want our character
to be doing the pirouette

79
00:04:58.118 --> 00:05:01.670
around the diamond,
then we will add a null

80
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.397
It will be centered on the
diamond, at least approximately.

81
00:05:08.565 --> 00:05:11.840
And we are going to link
our character to that null.

82
00:05:12.815 --> 00:05:14.070
Null Pirouette.

83
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.225
Because in this scene I imagine
the character doing such a rotation.

84
00:05:18.528 --> 00:05:20.500
So that kind of thing

85
00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.022
no need to make them
directly on all vector layers,

86
00:05:24.022 --> 00:05:27.505
because you have to work a
lot in intermediate transitions.

87
00:05:27.505 --> 00:05:31.113
We take advantage of this kind of
very simple rotation of After Effects

88
00:05:31.113 --> 00:05:32.838
to have it as a base.

89
00:05:35.338 --> 00:05:38.657
We will make such a movement,
as it comes from this point.

90
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.628
Go through the central point,
which we have already designed.

91
00:05:44.418 --> 00:05:46.522
And it comes more or less here.

92
00:05:47.828 --> 00:05:51.693
We still do not know how long it
will last, we will adjust times.

93
00:05:52.498 --> 00:05:57.048
But I can imagine that
it can start quite quickly

94
00:05:57.048 --> 00:05:59.833
and then have a
fairly linear movement.

95
00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:04.278
I imagine that in this
scene we can keep a movement

96
00:06:04.278 --> 00:06:07.543
slow motion in this part,

97
00:06:07.543 --> 00:06:11.498
and when the character
falls back to normal speed.

98
00:06:12.348 --> 00:06:16.853
There we see that at least a
little animation we are already adding.

99
00:06:16.853 --> 00:06:21.098
This is still very raw, but
we will see previous scenes

100
00:06:21.098 --> 00:06:23.635
If that kind of movement works.

101
00:06:30.768 --> 00:06:34.523
I think it's pretty good, I think
the fact of having this momentum

102
00:06:34.523 --> 00:06:36.288
up to the left

103
00:06:36.288 --> 00:06:38.470
It helps us connect with this moment

104
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.303
as if this foot we see
here is this foot we see here.

105
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.783
That movement, which also
continues up to the left,

106
00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:49.940
It helps us connect the two scenes.

107
00:06:52.333 --> 00:06:57.157
Now it is simply to adjust the poses
by animating the Paths to add detail.

108
00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:07.938
By the way, this depends on the keyboard
but there is a little button next to the 1

109
00:07:07.938 --> 00:07:10.398
which in my case has a tilde,

110
00:07:10.398 --> 00:07:14.610
which is what makes us
expand any of the panels

111
00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:16.368
We want from the interface.

112
00:07:17.248 --> 00:07:20.918
It's the same as double
clicking on the tab, for example.

113
00:07:21.428 --> 00:07:25.825
That helps us when we have to
do some work only in a panel.

114
00:07:26.258 --> 00:07:31.442
These keyframes that we have already
defined will fix them in the intermediate pose,

115
00:07:31.442 --> 00:07:33.760
The one we designed in our styleframe.

116
00:07:33.765 --> 00:07:36.798
We are going to adjust a
previous pose and a later pose.

117
00:07:36.798 --> 00:07:40.793
The posterior pose may be
similar to the reference we made.

118
00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:43.665
So let's take that as a reference.

119
00:07:44.018 --> 00:07:46.735
At first I don't care much about hair,

120
00:07:46.735 --> 00:07:51.498
since being an appendix type
element, that is, something that is added

121
00:07:52.792 --> 00:07:55.025
to the main body,

122
00:07:55.025 --> 00:07:59.237
It is the kind of elements that move
with some inertia, with Overlapping.

123
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.945
We usually leave that for last.

124
00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:05.055
I'm going to focus
first on the legs, which are

125
00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:07.480
The stars of this movement.

126
00:08:14.508 --> 00:08:18.663
With this same object we
will give it some rotation

127
00:08:18.663 --> 00:08:23.053
to avoid having to do full leg
rotation by moving the nodes.

128
00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:26.675
We are going to
locate the anchor here,

129
00:08:27.765 --> 00:08:31.613
and I'm going to give it some
rotation to help us in that movement.

130
00:08:31.613 --> 00:08:36.613
What we are going to need now is
to adjust the waist, let's say.

131
00:08:45.518 --> 00:08:48.545
I will put the hair
with some transparency

132
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.440
to draw from behind.

133
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:02.108
Again you have to do the
thorough work of adjusting nodes.

134
00:09:11.695 --> 00:09:15.162
It's going pretty well, but
again we found the situation

135
00:09:15.162 --> 00:09:20.193
that to rotate a part of
the body only with nodes,

136
00:09:20.193 --> 00:09:24.300
the volume is slightly deformed,
so again it has to be compensated.

137
00:09:57.948 --> 00:09:59.343
This is already taking shape.

138
00:09:59.923 --> 00:10:02.603
You will have to adjust
the speeds, of course.

139
00:10:04.915 --> 00:10:07.863
In fact, we had placed
this pose in the middle

140
00:10:07.863 --> 00:10:11.318
but now that our
movement has this acceleration,

141
00:10:11.318 --> 00:10:13.460
The midpoint is more or less here.

142
00:10:15.525 --> 00:10:19.465
So, all this has to happen
almost from the beginning.

143
00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:23.797
With Alt we can stretch the keyframes.

144
00:10:33.825 --> 00:10:37.073
We are going to adjust
some things of the pose again,

145
00:10:37.073 --> 00:10:38.757
following with the legs.

146
00:10:50.238 --> 00:10:54.197
This is pretty good,
just adjust the times.

147
00:10:54.348 --> 00:10:59.423
I calculated that this type of
movement will have a kind of slow motion here,

148
00:10:59.423 --> 00:11:03.033
but in the end, when the
character is about to fall,

149
00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:05.518
We will have a faster movement.

150
00:11:05.518 --> 00:11:10.940
So let's put all this
together and add a rotation here,

151
00:11:15.248 --> 00:11:20.025
That will be when the
acceleration increases again.

152
00:11:27.203 --> 00:11:31.275
We will return the opacity to the
hair and we will see how it looks.

153
00:11:47.265 --> 00:11:50.830
I think for now it's pretty
good, not counting that we're not

154
00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:52.235
cheering hair

155
00:11:52.235 --> 00:11:55.880
and also at this moment
when our character falls

156
00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.250
Go around that looks a bit weird.

157
00:11:58.898 --> 00:12:03.473
Because here he is perfectly on his
back and here he is just in front.

158
00:12:03.823 --> 00:12:09.023
But as we play with fantasy and
deforming things so that they are

159
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:11.560
as more playful, say,

160
00:12:11.578 --> 00:12:12.903
In this case it does not affect.
