1
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.440
Action

2
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.420
We will now continue with the
pose of the character when it falls.

3
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.410
This we can work from this layer,

4
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.950
since we don't need much
reference, not for now.

5
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.070
These layers are those of the
character keeping the diamond,

6
00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.600
that we will use them right away,

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.790
so we are going to run them now
and we are going to worry about them.

8
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.550
We follow the same process.

9
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.860
In this case, as the legs
are supported on the floor,

10
00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.160
we are not going to link
the legs with the torso,

11
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.350
since we need to move the
torso independently of the legs.

12
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.150
We leave all the keyframes
of the character standing

13
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.690
and we work in the pose

14
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.640
where our character fell on the floor.

15
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.980
The main thing is
that we lower the torso

16
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.120
To get an idea of how
much to flex your legs.

17
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.930
I missed animating the
position of the torso.

18
00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.100
You have to be careful,

19
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.290
Make sure to mark the properties
that we will encourage with the clock.

20
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.360
Position and rotation of
everything, just in case.

21
00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.060
So now.

22
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.040
The other thing we will do in this
first pose is to stretch our hands a little,

23
00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.730
The arms, really.

24
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.990
And in this case, as the hand
is going to be very different,

25
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.320
For now we can duplicate this layer.

26
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.780
We are going to make the
previous layer start a little later,

27
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.600
let's hide it

28
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.550
and we will work for now,
with the duplicated layer,

29
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:14.550
where we are going to eliminate
all the sub-layers of the hand,

30
00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.980
because we are going
to draw a new hand.

31
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.870
Because sometimes, if we
deform everything we have existing,

32
00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.330
We are very forced.

33
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.740
For example in this case,

34
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.810
this hand, being as pointing back,

35
00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.790
There are not many ways to make
it bend so that it points forward.

36
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.400
Then, we must draw a new hand.

37
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.030
And when it stops, we
carry this hand pose

38
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.240
to a kind of
anticipation with the elbow raised.

39
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.850
Thinking a bit about what staging is.

40
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.070
We will try to make this
movement more readable.

41
00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:11.850
So, let's move away the
part that weâ€™re encouraging,

42
00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:15.480
which in this case is
the arm, forearm and elbow,

43
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.340
in the opposite direction to
the one that will finally move,

44
00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.260
to exaggerate that movement.

45
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.760
Since the arm is
attached to the torso,

46
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.150
We can work with the
keyframes independently,

47
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.240
that the main movement
is given by the torso.

48
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.220
So, we can delay this a little

49
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.590
and give that
movement a bit of time lag.

50
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.440
So first we read how
the character stands

51
00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.000
and then how he rests
his hand on his hip,

52
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.030
As saying, I got it.

53
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.060
Here we are deforming quite ugly.

54
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.750
So, we have to adjust that a bit.

55
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.070
That's more or less good.

56
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.050
This hand that holds the diamond,

57
00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.100
having a precious object,

58
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.110
It will move like taking care of it.

59
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.850
So, I imagine it won't move much,

60
00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.950
It won't change much

61
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.880
since we are going to have
this hand in the same way,

62
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.740
always pointing up, to
keep the diamond standing.

63
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.390
And we can start
adding some small bounces,

64
00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.130
type "overlapping",

65
00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.110
for when, for
example, this part gets up,

66
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.090
to keep the balance when it stops,

67
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:53.800
It will have a small bounce.

68
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.930
Now, these movements
are very synchronized,

69
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.530
We have to try to
desynchronize those kinds of movements.

70
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.570
Let's work a little
more on the torso and legs,

71
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.380
They are too slow.

72
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.630
And the same, we give a
little "overlapping" here.

73
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:23.870
I usually help
myself with the keyboard,

74
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.130
using the arrows to move the nodes,

75
00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.990
since it is like a kind
of a universal measure.

76
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.520
If we move the torso
with Shift and once up,

77
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.310
We know that a certain amount moves,
that I don't know if they are 10 pixels.

78
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.340
And if we want to move the
nodes of the leg the same pixels,

79
00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.690
we can use the same unit of measure,

80
00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.920
That would be Shift up.

81
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.670
What we do have to take
care of is the acceleration.

82
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.130
And we have to do again

83
00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.870
that the animation of the
position of our torso is linear,

84
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.640
because if not, it
adds a lot of bounces

85
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.570
and some things we don't want.

86
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.060
So, if we put Keyframe
Interpolation, Linear,

87
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.620
We avoid such problems.

88
00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.100
This kind of "stretch" that I
give here is a bit exaggerated.

89
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:17.850
I have to deform the legs a
little to strengthen that.

90
00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.290
If it's a stretch, that
means it stretches up.

91
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.880
and the central parts shrink a little.

92
00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:27.910
So, I'm going to move
my knees to the center

93
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.980
and I will see how it looks
if I lift the taco a little.

94
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.420
This hand may need a double bounce.

95
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.020
Okay, you have to adjust the
times, but it is taking shape.

96
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.620
We can add here,

97
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.200
I'm anticipating a little

98
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.730
and I'm going to copy the
Posterize layer that I have in other scenes

99
00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.360
and I'm going to add it here to
see how it looks with this at 12.

100
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.900
It looks pretty good,

101
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:32.500
but in the part that makes
slow motion it looks half cut,

102
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:36.440
Maybe I should take it to a
larger amount of frames per second.

103
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:38.320
But for now it's going well.

104
00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:41.310
We will continue working
on the pose we were coming

105
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:43.700
To add details like the hand.

106
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.520
Since we must add a new drawing,

107
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.070
We use the Pen and draw a hand here.

108
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:10.030
I paint it with any
color, what we have to do now

109
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:13.960
It is to look for the
hand we have as a reference.

110
00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:18.220
Select with the Pen that
object and copy the color.

111
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:21.690
If we double click it,
we select only that object

112
00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.300
And we can paste the color and
apply the color hand to hand.

113
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.810
Now we have to order that new drawing.

114
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:30.910
Let's group

115
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:34.000
and we carry it below
so that it is behind.

116
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:39.000
And we are going to add some
details, such as the lines we were using.

117
00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.930
Again, let's look
for the existing hand,

118
00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.060
we select one of our lines

119
00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:51.720
and let's see what
color it has, copy it,

120
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:54.720
and see the size, which is 2 pixels.

121
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.490
So, in the new lines

122
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.760
we will select them and
we will paste the color,

123
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:02.540
we remove the padding
and 2 pixels, that's fine.

124
00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.340
So, there we have our
beautiful little hand.

125
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:08.720
We carry the two new
Shapes of the lines

126
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.210
within the new hand group

127
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:14.820
and now we must animate those Paths.

128
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.530
Now here we must copy the
acceleration that we already have in our arm,

129
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:55.860
for the hand

130
00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:23.730
Good and the moment the hand hits,

131
00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:26.460
We are going to make it
a bit more exaggerated.

132
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.590
Let's cut this layer

133
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.450
and we will show the other.

134
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:31.860
We already have it ready.

135
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.040
Now it was a bit weird,
because this layer has no animation,

136
00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:42.360
so, let's give it a
little "overshoot".

137
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.980
Let's see how it looks.

138
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.320
I add the Posterize layer.

139
00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.200
We animate the Frame Rate,

140
00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:22.330
so that in the
first pictures it is 24,

141
00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.360
So we see a couple
of pictures very fast.

142
00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:28.570
When it is about to
fall again it returns to 24

143
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:33.190
and finally, when he is already making
contact with the floor, we return to 12.

144
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:35.000
We see how it looks.

145
00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.910
It is quite good.

146
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:45.580
That is, details are
still missing, such as hair,

147
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.590
That looks like a
red without much sense.

148
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:50.520
We have to cheer him up a bit.

149
00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:54.710
That hand could also
have some movement,

150
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:57.970
you have to make the
moment when you grab the diamond

151
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.480
and something that I would also
like to add is a contact pose,

152
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:05.860
just before between this and this,

153
00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:07.960
I imagine it can be

154
00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.660
a pose based on this,

155
00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.490
but maybe supporting only one foot

156
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.860
and with the other foot raised.

157
00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.890
So, let's move
everything we already have

158
00:13:19.890 --> 00:13:21.700
two frames for the right

159
00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:24.570
and we are going to
stretch the layers a little more,

160
00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.480
to have two pictures
before the movement.

161
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.110
And now based on this,

162
00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.780
I will recover the
original position of the torso

163
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:40.560
and the original shape
and position of the legs.

164
00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:43.340
So, so we have in principle,

165
00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:46.430
This should not have any acceleration.

166
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.180
And there we have when it falls,

167
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:54.940
but I would like to give this
pose a little more movement,

168
00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.310
to show it as an
intermediate situation,

169
00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:01.650
maybe in which the
leg is still in the air.

170
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.850
And maybe, the torso
can be a little up,

171
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.300
maybe even a little to
the right to balance.

172
00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.480
Maybe a rotation.

173
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.730
So, when it supports, we
will give it a counter rotation.

174
00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.430
What I want to do here is
to stretch my legs a little.

175
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:54.660
Here at this time,

176
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.680
the joint goes a bit
against natural movement,

177
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.240
since it goes as against the knee,

178
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:05.810
but that kind of thing helps us
to give it more expressiveness.

179
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.150
I'm not going to worry
about the middle frame,

180
00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:14.020
because now it will be 12,

181
00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.510
so the middle frame will not exist.

182
00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:36.020
Let's do something
similar with the arm,

183
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:40.510
let's assume that it comes from a
position where you are looking up.

184
00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:58.520
So, there we connect these
two poses a little better.

185
00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:03.120
I'm going to correct
the leg volumes a bit.

186
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.780
And see now.
