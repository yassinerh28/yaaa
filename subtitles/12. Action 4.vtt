1
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.500
Action

2
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.020
We're almost ready, but
we're going to add details,

3
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.280
like the movement in which
the hand grabs the diamond,

4
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.060
that we are going to take
advantage of this acceleration

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.440
to pretend to grab it,
but really, we won't see it

6
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.820
in a very obvious way.

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.310
We must add movement to the hair

8
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.420
and other details that we see.

9
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.560
When we animate, we have
to hide the Posterize layer

10
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.070
so as not to confuse us,

11
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.480
because if not, we will see

12
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.450
the result with fewer
pictures than we encourage.

13
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.540
Here we will try to do

14
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.370
that our character
comes from a rotation,

15
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.200
We just had it on our backs
and now look straight ahead.

16
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.370
So, let's try to simulate

17
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.700
that comes from looking to the side.

18
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.140
So when the character settles,

19
00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.760
the hair should bounce a little down

20
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.360
and climb up to accommodate.

21
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.030
With the principles of
"squash and stretch",

22
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.400
every time they crush
or stretch something,

23
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.420
it has to widen it for the sides

24
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.830
or make it narrower respectively.

25
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.300
Now we will see what to do
with the hair in this pose.

26
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.020
Something like that is fine now.

27
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.240
Missing add Posterize layer

28
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.470
and now let's see
how everything looks,

29
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.980
linking it to the camera.

30
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.930
We have the Null de la Pirueta

31
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.060
and the other
precomps of the characters,

32
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.320
we link them to the Chamber Null

33
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.920
and we don't have to
forget the bottom line.

34
00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.150
Maybe the movement can
start a little earlier.

35
00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.980
You just have to make the
character grab the diamond there,

36
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.110
we made the hand movement,

37
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.800
but we have to
disappear the diamond right now

38
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.470
and make it appear with the character.

39
00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.540
We are going to duplicate this
layer, bottom-end-without-diamond.

40
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.530
With Control + Shift + D,

41
00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.730
we duplicate the layer and cut it now,

42
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:57.010
so, we carry the
bottom-end-without-diamond,

43
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.210
When the character grabs it.

44
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.210
So, we copy the diamond and hide it

45
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.060
and we take it to
the character standing.

46
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.510
And we will link it to the arm layer.

47
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.990
And we will animate your
position and your rotation as needed

48
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.410
to link it perfectly with
the position of the hand.

49
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:36.110
We will add a keyframe for
each keyframe that has the arm.

50
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.750
To give a final touch to the scene,

51
00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.810
I would like to add "smear frames".

52
00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.580
If you don't know what they
are, I'm going to tell you.

53
00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.390
Smear frames are
these types of drawings.

54
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.750
that are used to
represent a very fast action

55
00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.190
What would happen between two frames.

56
00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.540
So what is done is
how to show those frames

57
00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.580
that are tried to
represent in a single image.

58
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.460
That's why they sometimes
show how we see many drawings,

59
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:41.400
represented in the same space,
as here, that the eye is repeated

60
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.020
or like here, they try to
represent that kind of motion blur

61
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:46.840
with gestural strokes

62
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:53.000
or in this image, that the only thing
you do directly is to repeat the object,

63
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.010
as if showing the positions
they represent at the same time.

64
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:00.190
This is a particular case, it
does not duplicate any elements,

65
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.950
but it is showing

66
00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.150
part of the next frame and
part of the previous frame.

67
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.080
Taken to a simpler representation,

68
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.210
we can see it in an example like this,

69
00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:15.020
where we see first
this stick that moves,

70
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.000
that doesn't have any smear

71
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.550
But we can add one.

72
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.110
I don't know if it looks,

73
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.820
but there is a frame in which the
outline of the object is dragged,

74
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.310
to represent the speed of movement.

75
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.420
That gives it much more impact.

76
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.740
This is the frame that
represents the "smear frame".

77
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:39.270
Another technique is to repeat the
object, instead of dragging it many times,

78
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:42.910
as if we were showing several frames
at the same time, something like that.

79
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.560
The thing to be careful with
this is not to use it too much.

80
00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.040
When we begin to show that the
object creeps in each movement,

81
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.850
it starts to feel like
the object is a stain

82
00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:56.080
or some rubber

83
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.630
And we don't want that.

84
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:01.120
It should be used only
in very fast movements

85
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.810
and if possible, it can be
seen in a single frame or two.

86
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.520
In our case, I was
exploring an option first,

87
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.090
at the moment the
character goes down to the floor,

88
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.180
The fastest moment of action.

89
00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:20.380
What I did was drag the
figure of the legs a little

90
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:24.780
to make that movement
feel more accelerated.

91
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.790
If we give Play, it looks like this.

92
00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.650
If we don't look,
it's almost imperceptible

93
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:37.680
and that is the idea of "smear frames",
which are not detected with the naked eye,

94
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:41.800
They help give more
action to a movement.

95
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.630
I tried this option first

96
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.430
and then I tried another one,

97
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:50.630
in which I use the way of repeating
the object with a little transparency,

98
00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:55.000
that helps us feel the
feeling that we are showing

99
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.670
several frames at the same time

100
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.690
And with our design I
think this works better.

101
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.450
It is barely noticeable,

102
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.570
but since the movement is
very strong, with few frames,

103
00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.230
this helps us to show
a little more the way

104
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:14.790
What does the leg do, in this case.

105
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.230
Finally, I also thought
it might be a good idea.

106
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.060
add one at this time,

107
00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:24.130
since the character is
grabbing the diamond in this position

108
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:27.290
and suddenly we see how
it jumps at this point

109
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:32.840
and we don't have any
intermediate drawing to show that transition.

110
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.080
So, I thought to do it
with a "smear frame",

111
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.850
that at a glance,
pausing in this frame,

112
00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:42.260
It can look a little weird,
because it's like an isolated object,

113
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.010
but if we give Play, it
gives us a little feeling

114
00:09:45.010 --> 00:09:50.140
That is the character that is
moving his arm very quickly.

115
00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:54.800
So, it helps us a little to
connect this scene with this one,

116
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.400
showing a bit of an
intermediate frame.

117
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:02.120
The idea is to explore with
this and see what things work,

118
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.290
because it depends on the character’s
design and the action you’re taking,

119
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.520
It is the type of "smear
frame" that we will use.

120
00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.520
My recommendation is that
the way to apply it is subtle

121
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.500
and that is not
detected with the naked eye,

122
00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.770
but help to understand

123
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.690
what was happening, the
movement of the character.

124
00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:24.590
I also recommend using it when
animating at 24 frames per second.

125
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.640
In my Posterize layer right now,

126
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:32.830
We have 24 frames per
second, so each frame is a drawing.

127
00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:38.020
So in this case, we have a frame
where we have this "smear frame" here,

128
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.470
In the following is this and voila.

129
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.230
The moment we stretch this longer,

130
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:47.510
It becomes too noticeable
and that is not the idea.

131
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:53.400
To help us locate the elements to
duplicate in the "smear frames",

132
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.540
we can add a layer of Echo,

133
00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:58.210
where we see where
the character comes from

134
00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.970
and what is the movement
in the previous frames.

135
00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.960
It's like a kind of
"onion skin" in other programs,

136
00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.200
It is the most similar in After.

137
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:08.920
So what I wanted to do with this frame

138
00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:10.540
is to put the leg

139
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.540
connecting a little
when it comes from above

140
00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.880
for when it will be located below.

141
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:19.130
Then let's not forget to
remove that layer or hide it.

142
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:22.550
Finally, as a last detail,

143
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:25.750
I added a sparkle to
the diamond right now,

144
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.640
actually two glitters,

145
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.440
to bring attention to that moment.

146
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.700
We don't have to forget

147
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:34.080
That the idea is that
history be understood.

148
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.220
If we show that the diamond is in
a position and suddenly it is not,

149
00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.660
These glows help us
guide the eye to that point.

150
00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.840
And so we end this scene.

151
00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.390
With this we finish the action scene

152
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.210
and I hope you have fun adding
"smear frames" to your animation.
