1
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.480
Walking

2
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.200
In this lesson we will focus on
the character's walking action.

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.820
We will take as a reference
the bases of Richard Williams,

4
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.720
and we'll see how to apply them
in the animation in After Effects.

5
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.720
Until now, we had come here.

6
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.400
Then, I added the part where
the diamond is stored in the bag

7
00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:36.575
and finally he walks.

8
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.400
For the part where
the diamond is stored,

9
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.960
I added this new precomp

10
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.220
in which we had our
design with this pose

11
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.160
and then I worked on the
transitions to get to the moment

12
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.480
in which the diamond
is stored in the bag.

13
00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.030
I did this the same way
we have been doing so far,

14
00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.720
animating everything with Paths
and took longer than it seems.

15
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.720
It's a pretty simple animation.

16
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.620
but there are very
complex arm movements

17
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.120
that go from side to side

18
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.840
and this makes it
consume a lot of time.

19
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.800
That's why it's good beforehand

20
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.300
try to think of quite
simple, flat animations,

21
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.160
and avoid this kind of thing, in
which an arm passes to the side,

22
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.273
ahead of the body, which
comes from the other side.

23
00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:23.990
Anyway, if we see it frame by frame,

24
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.040
the animation is not
perfect, there are some jumps,

25
00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:31.488
but, in the end, with the resource of
lowering the frames per second to twelve,

26
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.603
and with the camera,
which is a bit far away,

27
00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:35.920
Those moments go unnoticed.

28
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.480
So, what we have to try to do

29
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.920
is to prioritize the
important movements for reading

30
00:01:42.053 --> 00:01:44.863
and work the best we
can on the details.

31
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.360
To start with the walk,

32
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.380
We will do as we always do.

33
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.730
We import the layers of our design,

34
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.920
we separate the
layers, we assign colors

35
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.200
and relating what is needed.

36
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.200
In this case, we do not
match the legs to the torso

37
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.200
because we want the
torso to move up and down,

38
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.108
regardless of the legs.

39
00:02:07.108 --> 00:02:10.198
When we have the
first pose already staged,

40
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.560
separated in layers, ready to animate,

41
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.960
We already have in this
case the contact pose,

42
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.480
which is the extreme moment,

43
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.120
in which the legs contact the floor.

44
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.760
To know how to continue with
the rest of our cycle poses,

45
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.560
We will look for a reference.

46
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.480
I recommend doing this always,

47
00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.480
even if they already know
how to do a walking cycle

48
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.120
you can search for this reference

49
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.440
because it's good
to take it as a base.

50
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.000
If we search for "walk
cycle" in Google Images,

51
00:02:40.103 --> 00:02:44.378
We will see many references
and ways to encourage this.

52
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.280
The one I recommend is one
of the most repeated images,

53
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.360
which is the one taken
from Richard Williams' book.

54
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.920
I recommend reading the book

55
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.880
But for now, using
this reference is fine.

56
00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.115
We will save it and use
it in our After project.

57
00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:04.600
We will import the
image to our project

58
00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.800
to have it as a reference.

59
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.170
Let's put as a mode in Guide.

60
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.200
It doesn't matter if
it's on the other side,

61
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.920
what we want to know
is the number of poses

62
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.690
what we have to do and
the height of each one.

63
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.600
As in this reference,

64
00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.640
In our walking cycle
we do these five poses,

65
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.080
of which, if you look, five and one

66
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.180
They are basically the
same, only it changes legs.

67
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.640
So, I placed these markers

68
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.040
equidistant, they all
have the same distance,

69
00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.878
which in this case
are only four frames.

70
00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.988
Do not worry about time
because then you can adjust it.

71
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.728
The important thing is
that they are equidistant.

72
00:03:42.728 --> 00:03:46.000
So, the first pose we
have is the contact one.

73
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.740
For the next one, the
torso will go down a bit,

74
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.520
the foot will fully support

75
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.320
and the one behind gets up a little.

76
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.840
So, animating the vector
layers of the legs and torso,

77
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.328
we can try to imitate these poses,

78
00:03:59.328 --> 00:04:01.460
adapting them to our character.

79
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.880
Let's try to solve in the
legs how the poses would be.

80
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.420
This is the Down pose, which
is when you get all the weight

81
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.220
After contact, you
receive it on this foot.

82
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.000
And it starts to rise.

83
00:04:14.028 --> 00:04:15.978
Then follow the highest pose,

84
00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:19.855
This foot is practically
stretched and the other begins to pass.

85
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.680
Follow this pose in
which the back foot

86
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.100
is almost forward, about to step on,

87
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.600
and finally we finish
in the next contact pose,

88
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.560
where we exchange both feet.

89
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.150
For the first cycle, I recommend

90
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.840
concentrate, above
all, first on the legs.

91
00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.160
All other details, for
example this shadow line,

92
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.120
we hide it for now and
we will add it at the end,

93
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.278
when we are happy with the cycle.

94
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.080
In addition to adding leg keyframes,

95
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.120
that in this case, for
example, I had to add one more

96
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.500
to be able to make that
transition a bit more real

97
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.900
at the time I was touching the floor,

98
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.080
because otherwise, if
at the time of contact

99
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.440
when the cue touches the
floor, we move on to this moment,

100
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.100
Without that intermediate
keyframe, the foot flies a little.

101
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.680
So, I wanted to add it
to make it touch the floor

102
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.240
and by the way I gave some
flexibility to the instep.

103
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.360
In addition to leg movement,

104
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.180
We will cheer our torso vertically.

105
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.360
If we see the curve, it is very
similar to the curve I describe here.

106
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:29.900
At the contact points
it remains the same,

107
00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.360
the height of the first contact
point is the same as the second.

108
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.840
Then lower in the support position

109
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.620
and start climbing to the highest pose

110
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.560
which is where the front
foot is about to support.

111
00:05:42.193 --> 00:05:44.213
If we see this in cycle,

112
00:05:44.283 --> 00:05:46.908
We already have a walking cycle.

113
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.783
Now, for this to be a walking cycle

114
00:05:50.805 --> 00:05:53.943
that transmits a true
displacement of the character,

115
00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.880
We will consider some things.

116
00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.200
In addition to all the
details that we will add later,

117
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.840
like bounces in the
hair, the line here,

118
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.800
and details in the way the feet move,

119
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.040
but most importantly,
when a character is walking,

120
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.920
at all times when your feet
are in contact with the floor,

121
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.120
they have to move at the same speed,

122
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.640
since what we are going
to do is a cycle in place

123
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.720
to which we will
later relate to a null

124
00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.520
That will have a displacement.

125
00:06:26.913 --> 00:06:29.445
So, what we will do is create a null

126
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.600
that will have a
movement in X to the left,

127
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.760
which is the direction in
which our character moves.

128
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.240
Now, to know how
much we have to move it,

129
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.280
One trick is to add some guide layers.

130
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.840
What I did was add a
layer for each foot

131
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.700
to have as reference the
location where each foot steps.

132
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.640
In addition to this, all
kinds of guides we can use

133
00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.390
To facilitate the construction of
walking cycle, they will come in handy.

134
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.400
For example I also
like to paint a color

135
00:07:02.603 --> 00:07:06.203
the back leg to
differentiate it from the front leg.

136
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.060
We are going to keep it that
way throughout the walking cycle.

137
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.070
until we are happy
and we just hide it.

138
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.660
So, we have this
greener color for the back leg

139
00:07:16.905 --> 00:07:18.995
and this more blue
for the one in front.

140
00:07:20.018 --> 00:07:23.618
Now that we have our
five poses located,

141
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.053
what we are going to
do is adjust the foot

142
00:07:26.053 --> 00:07:29.258
to ensure that it
travels at floor speed.

143
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.270
This null has a constant speed in X.

144
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:35.320
What I did was also add an expression,

145
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.800
which is continuous
LoopOut, which extends that speed

146
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.800
in which we define those two nodes

147
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.060
and continue that
movement perpetually.

148
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:50.000
That serves so that, even
if we locate only two nodes

149
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.240
for one cycle, the null will
continue to move indefinitely.

150
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.140
So, so far we have
all the poses assigned,

151
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.020
more or less drawn, as they
correspond to this drawing,

152
00:08:02.323 --> 00:08:05.643
and we are in the first
phase, which is the contact one,

153
00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:11.060
we place these pictures on
each foot of the character.

154
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.320
We link these two
pictures with a new null.

155
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.440
This new null has no keyframe,

156
00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.000
but it does have an expression in
the animation, in the position of X,

157
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.070
which is basically the
negative of the null below.

158
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:31.120
We have the main null,

159
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:34.830
which is what we are going to
link to our character in a moment.

160
00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.643
Then we create this second null

161
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.640
that will go at the same speed as the
other but in the opposite direction.

162
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.940
Let's go to the expression

163
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:49.343
of the X position,
simply with Alt + Click.

164
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:54.240
What we do is put less in
the position of the other X.

165
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.640
He puts it anywhere, but
that doesn't interest us.

166
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:01.240
What interests us is
to have those two nulls

167
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:03.080
going at opposite speeds.

168
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.160
This can be done
without an expression.

169
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:08.760
and simply copying and pasting the
keyframes and turning them around.

170
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.400
The good thing about making the
expression is that, whenever we modify

171
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.840
One of the keyframes,
both will be modified.

172
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:16.860
This seems all very complex

173
00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:20.140
but, in reality, it is only to
be able to generate these guides.

174
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.910
What we want with the guides is
that they move at constant speed.

175
00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:27.660
Once with the null in
the reverse direction,

176
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.840
We are going to link
these two guides to that null.

177
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:36.240
With that, we adjust the
speed at which the null moves.

178
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.860
How do we do that?

179
00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.728
I deleted the keyframe so as
not to have it as a reference.

180
00:09:40.728 --> 00:09:43.440
Let's go to our last position,

181
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.040
and we will try to
make this blue square

182
00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:48.483
be located where our new foot is.

183
00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:51.400
Then we carry ...

184
00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:55.600
the null to that position.

185
00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.760
This gives us the speed at
which the character moves.

186
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.480
So, the good thing about
this is that we now have

187
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.000
these two reference frames
moving at constant speed.

188
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.720
We have to make sure that in
each of the intermediate poses

189
00:10:09.915 --> 00:10:12.493
The feet match the reference guide.

190
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.440
Surely when we draw
them, as happened to me,

191
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.840
We had one foot first here or here.

192
00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:21.063
If we make the feet match the square,

193
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.920
at all times, until
he gets up, like here,

194
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.840
we have to think that
they are a few steps,

195
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.720
some platforms on
which the character walks.

196
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.860
If we do that, we will make sure

197
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.700
that the feet move
at a constant speed.

198
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.860
Then we can link the entire character

199
00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.500
which would basically
be the torso and legs,

200
00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:47.720
since the rest of the
layers are linked to the torso.

201
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:54.040
If we link all those
layers with the main Null X,

202
00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:57.520
We see that the character
begins to move across the floor.

203
00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.980
We are going to hide the
guides so we don't get confused.

204
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.060
and we will see that
he is already walking.

205
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.240
That the feet move at a constant speed

206
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.640
makes, when we move it, in appearance,

207
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:14.540
The foot does not move, but
is in contact with the floor.

208
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.720
I'm going back and I'm
going to show you what's up

209
00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:19.440
If we don't make that match.

210
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.400
For example, let's
take this foot there.

211
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.280
Maybe without the guides
and at a glance it looks good,

212
00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.060
it may even look more like the pose,

213
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.680
but, I'm going to make
this a bit more exaggerated,

214
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.320
if later we make all our character

215
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.460
move at a constant speed,

216
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:42.960
linking it to Null X, we will see
that foot makes strange movements.

217
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:47.420
It has for example a drag
that is very disconcerting.

218
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.160
To avoid such things,
we use these guides.

219
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.520
Once we have legs and
torso with basic movement,

220
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.680
We could start adding detail.

221
00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.400
But what we have is
not yet a complete cycle,

222
00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:03.020
We simply have one leg.

223
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.460
The character is not inverted, yet.

224
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:08.220
We have to do that,
again, the front leg

225
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.360
Go forward again.

226
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.920
Thus we begin the cycle
again from the beginning.

227
00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.820
If you want to make a
profile view of your character

228
00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:22.560
Like the one in this
reference, you can copy the keyframes

229
00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.560
from one leg and glue it to the other

230
00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:28.080
or use the same movement as a
reference and it would look good.

231
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.200
But actually,

232
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.360
our character is with a
kind of three quarters,

233
00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.960
It has a view that
is just a bit lateral.

234
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:40.140
So, when the front foot is forward,

235
00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.600
It is affected by this
three-quarter perspective we have.

236
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:49.120
It doesn't look exactly
the same as when it's behind.

237
00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.920
For this, what can come in handy

238
00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.920
is to use some sketches
to have as a reference

239
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.540
and thus be able to make
sure how to locate the feet.

240
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.220
For that, let's go back
to Photoshop for a moment.

241
00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.720
Let's go back to the
character's walking sketch.

242
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:10.120
This pose was fine, in which,
from this view three quarters,

243
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.200
we see a little of the right shoulder

244
00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.440
and we see how the left leg is back.

245
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.560
And we see enough in
front of the character.

246
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.140
But, when you change your foot,
the view is a little different

247
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.600
because the character
takes the left part forward.

248
00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.520
That makes the right arm hide a little

249
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.160
and that the shape of
the hip look different.

250
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.320
That's because on the walks

251
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.260
the character makes a
swinging movement with the shoulders

252
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.260
forward and backward,
with a slight inclination.

253
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.080
In addition, perspective
affects the way we see the feet.

254
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.980
The more front you see, the
less distance between your feet.

255
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.560
And, if we see it
from this point of view,

256
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.880
The point at which each foot
begins has a small separation.

257
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.280
If we draw a kind of bony here,

258
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:03.520
we will see that the hip makes
the feet a little more separated.

259
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.940
The legs, sorry.

260
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.920
If we superimpose the two drawings,

261
00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:09.560
let's see that they
don't match, exactly.

262
00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:12.060
When you have the right foot forward,

263
00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.640
the feet are further apart

264
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.960
and when he has his right foot back,

265
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.240
the feet are perceived
a little more together.

266
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.800
We carry these two images as
a reference to have in After

267
00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.920
and be able to cheer on that.
