00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.480
Walking

2
00:00:10.883 --> 00:00:15.100
Importing these two
images as a reference,

3
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.940
We can continue with the second part
of the cycle, which is what I did here.

4
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.293
Here we see that I took Point 1
to Point 5, which we already had,

5
00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:30.900
Then, from Point 5 to Point 9,
in which I added 4 more steps,

6
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.998
whereby we return to
the first initial pose,

7
00:00:33.998 --> 00:00:35.100
which is number 1

8
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.820
With this we already
have a complete cycle.

9
00:00:38.848 --> 00:00:42.055
In this case I already added
some movement to the torso,

10
00:00:42.055 --> 00:00:44.863
where we can see a
slight movement of shoulders,

11
00:00:44.863 --> 00:00:48.743
since I used the different
poses that we had as a reference

12
00:00:48.743 --> 00:00:53.460
to trace the silhouette of the
point where one foot is ahead

13
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.940
and the point where
the other foot is ahead.

14
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.180
So, thanks for having those drawings,

15
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.220
I could give more
character to our character

16
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.140
and thus making our walking
cycle a little more advanced.

17
00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:11.220
To continue with the second
foot, I followed the same process,

18
00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:15.020
I cheered my legs and, for the torso,

19
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.620
I could repeat the movement in Y,

20
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.833
since for each cycle it is
the same type of movement.

21
00:01:20.833 --> 00:01:26.260
Go down in the same
support pose, go back up,

22
00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.095
follow the intermediate point in
the contact pose and lower again.

23
00:01:31.185 --> 00:01:36.540
In addition to that Y movement,
I added animation to the vector

24
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.260
to pass, from this moment, to the
moment where we see it more from the front.

25
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.980
If we see the lively
torso, just do this,

26
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.900
Then I added the bag,

27
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.540
since it is an object that
was almost part of the torso,

28
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.540
and the arms, the
front arm and the back arm,

29
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.285
that from this view, the
back arm is not visible,

30
00:01:57.285 --> 00:02:00.580
but in this position a
little appears already.

31
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.323
The arms help us give it a
little more dimensionality,

32
00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:08.260
understand a little more that
is a three-dimensional person

33
00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.500
and that he is moving his
shoulders naturally when walking.

34
00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.820
Then, at the time of
animating the second leg cycle,

35
00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.340
it can be useful to
copy all the keyframes

36
00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.223
that they have for the first
cycle and paste them in a new layer,

37
00:02:22.223 --> 00:02:24.150
They can use as a reference.

38
00:02:25.173 --> 00:02:28.268
If we go here, we will see
that exactly does not match,

39
00:02:28.268 --> 00:02:31.580
from what we said from the
perspective point of view,

40
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.388
but let's see that the
poses are practically the same,

41
00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:39.820
just change the location
of the edges, let's say.

42
00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.140
So, having that as a
reference can help you follow

43
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.300
the second part of the cycle
and make it a little easier.

44
00:02:48.088 --> 00:02:52.380
We already have our
first complete walking cycle,

45
00:02:53.383 --> 00:02:56.220
but we can still take
it a little further.

46
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.500
If we see it now, the face does not
move, the hair is completely solid

47
00:03:02.393 --> 00:03:06.700
and our walk is fine
but it's quite generic,

48
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.700
In fact, it looks a little
locked because it is too structured.

49
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.820
If we enter the keyframes of our leg,

50
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.808
they are totally distant
everyone, that's fine for a normal cycle,

51
00:03:19.808 --> 00:03:23.570
But maybe we can find a way
to give it more personality.

52
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.660
Also if we start to see
the intermediate tables,

53
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.723
let's see how this leg
happens, for example,

54
00:03:29.723 --> 00:03:34.485
that the scale changes a lot, it
deforms a little between point and point,

55
00:03:34.488 --> 00:03:37.460
especially because it’s a rotation,

56
00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.140
and sometimes strange
things happen in between.

57
00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.048
What we will do in the next
stage is to correct all those details

58
00:03:45.048 --> 00:03:48.660
and give our
character a little more life.

59
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.200
That's what I did in that
instance, in which maybe now

60
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.460
floor guides are no longer needed

61
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:57.140
And we can
concentrate on adding detail.

62
00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.073
Here I still did not focus on the top,

63
00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.695
but I preferred to
prioritize the legs.

64
00:04:02.695 --> 00:04:06.740
If we see the leg
keyframes in this version,

65
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.380
Here the thing changes a little.

66
00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.815
Here all I did was
change a pose, which is this,

67
00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:17.340
in which I made this leg,

68
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.713
if we look for the pose between four
and five of the previous version ...

69
00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.820
let's see pose number four ...

70
00:04:29.258 --> 00:04:33.020
it's the moment where
the foot is moving forward,

71
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.580
preparing to support, according
to Richard Williams reference,

72
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.540
this point would be equivalent,
where the foot is still flexed,

73
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.700
but not yet fully forward

74
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.180
and is preparing for
the point of contact.

75
00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.940
What I did in this design
was to keep it well under

76
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.700
because I wanted to give
him a carefree personality.

77
00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.260
If we make the leg rise a lot,

78
00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.900
It’s going to look like he’s stomping,

79
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.110
and I wanted to give the
character a relaxed look.

80
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.595
What I did was take
that a little further

81
00:05:06.595 --> 00:05:08.820
and do that in pose number four,

82
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.140
instead of having
your foot looking down,

83
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.780
I did a little looking up

84
00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.480
to make a kind of
kick before supporting.

85
00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.900
What I wanted to do with this was
to give it a little more carefree,

86
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.700
almost as if it were kicking pebbles.

87
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.500
Then what I did was
that this keyframe,

88
00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.260
which corresponds to the
same but to the other leg,

89
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:36.408
instead of being nailed and
linear about the moment of pose four,

90
00:05:36.408 --> 00:05:40.635
I gave them a little bit of
acceleration, from Ease in and Ease out with F9,

91
00:05:40.635 --> 00:05:45.620
and I delayed them a little,
since when my foot was stretched,

92
00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.580
Now he has a little
more trajectory to go,

93
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.140
So with this, what I
did was add some details

94
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.310
to other transitions,
for example here ...

95
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.620
and I added a point here
because if not, our foot became tiny.

96
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:06.780
So if we see this
concentrated on the legs,

97
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.983
let's see that it is equal
to the previous walking cycle

98
00:06:10.983 --> 00:06:13.540
but he has a moment
where he stretches his legs,

99
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.140
So with that I wanted to
give it a more relaxed look.

100
00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.573
After adjusting that kind of
thing to give it personality,

101
00:06:20.573 --> 00:06:23.460
I also worried about
adjusting the volumes.

102
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.060
Since we are cheering with
"shapes", we must be very careful

103
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.900
when we do each of the poses,

104
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.260
Let our leg feel that
it is the same object.

105
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.405
For example, this leg becomes
too curved and should not be so.

106
00:06:38.405 --> 00:06:42.380
We have to correct
things to make it look natural

107
00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:46.100
and so that they seem to have
the same volume, the same mass.

108
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.540
Here too this looks a bit weird,

109
00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.700
then little by little we are
going to adjust that kind of thing

110
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:54.380
so that our walk looks natural.

111
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.300
Once I was happy

112
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.740
with the character's leg movement,

113
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.500
I continued with the top.

114
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.503
What I did was edit
the face shapes a bit

115
00:07:06.503 --> 00:07:09.700
to continue the movement of the torso.

116
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.120
So if we see the torso with the arms,

117
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.260
the character is doing this swing

118
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:17.660
for left and right with each step.

119
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.460
What I did was add a
keyframe at each end to the face

120
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.608
in which, when you look more for
one side, it is more compacted,

121
00:07:26.608 --> 00:07:30.500
and when he looks more
forward, the face stretches,

122
00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.140
That makes it give us
a feeling of volume.

123
00:07:35.245 --> 00:07:38.740
After having all those things
ready, I could continue with my hair

124
00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.700
which I usually leave for the end,
since it is an appendix type object,

125
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:47.380
something that is
attached to our main character.

126
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.643
What I did was give it a bounce.

127
00:07:49.643 --> 00:07:53.460
I made the rebound quite
exaggerated thinking that, in this instance,

128
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.180
Our character will be quite far
away and I wanted that to be noticed.

129
00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.648
If we see everything
together, something like that remains.

130
00:08:06.545 --> 00:08:10.460
Finally, once I had
decided on the leg movement,

131
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:13.628
I removed this color
effect for reference

132
00:08:13.628 --> 00:08:17.980
and I added the line that will
divide us one leg of the other.

133
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:22.340
In this case, as the movement
of the leg makes it pass by,

134
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:26.540
I had to add another line
to divide that leg moment.

135
00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:30.230
Depending on the design they make,
these types of lines would not be necessary,

136
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:34.580
maybe they can just make
their leg a little darker,

137
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:40.008
that the back leg is darker, and with
that they already give it dimensionality,

138
00:08:40.008 --> 00:08:43.820
But as I like to get
complicated, I looked for a design

139
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.980
in which you will
separate the figure with lines.

140
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.260
That kind of thing is what also gives

141
00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:52.140
a little more square look,

142
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.540
since they are things that
are not usually used much

143
00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:56.300
in animation in After Effects.

144
00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.323
For the lines, I only added
keyframes at times when it was needed.

145
00:09:01.323 --> 00:09:03.528
Sometimes they are one per frame ...

146
00:09:05.013 --> 00:09:06.708
and sometimes one per pose,

147
00:09:06.708 --> 00:09:09.750
since interpolation did quite well.

148
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:16.180
Finally, as a last stage,
what we had left was to do

149
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:20.820
that our character is
related to the Null scroll

150
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.740
to move on the floor.

151
00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.233
We can hide the guides and we
already have our final animation,

152
00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:32.830
but our previous scene had
a totally different pose.

153
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.943
So, once I had the
walking cycle ready,

154
00:09:35.943 --> 00:09:38.500
What I did was work on the transition.

155
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.860
On the one hand, after the
character saves the diamond,

156
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:47.220
Make a small anticipation where
it starts to move to the left.

157
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.220
This is a small anticipation
that leads to our character

158
00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:54.940
to a slightly more neutral pose
where it is not so pulled from that side.

159
00:09:54.940 --> 00:10:00.580
What I did was take it as a reference
and then include it as a guide layer ...

160
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.240
in our animation.

161
00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:07.620
I more or less included the
character where I was going

162
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.540
and taking it as a reference, I
started working in a new pose.

163
00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.300
For that reason, when
I do a walking cycle,

164
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.500
I usually leave some time at
the beginning without cheering

165
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.140
to be able to add a
transition, if necessary.

166
00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:25.980
If we start from frame 0,
no problem, we can move it,

167
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.278
we stretch it and add any
previous animation we need,

168
00:10:30.278 --> 00:10:32.993
In this case, the time I
already had came in handy.

169
00:10:32.993 --> 00:10:37.173
So what I did was, from
the first step we took

170
00:10:37.173 --> 00:10:40.238
for the first phase
of our walking cycle,

171
00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:44.420
I was in reverse
process adding transitions,

172
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.598
until you reach a pose that
resembles the last of our previous stage.

173
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:53.020
For that, I added keyframes as needed.

174
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:57.210
For example, the legs do
this, they do it quickly,

175
00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:01.763
but basically one foot stays
still and the other starts moving ...

176
00:11:02.898 --> 00:11:07.820
until they reach the contact pose
where we can start with that cycle.

177
00:11:09.053 --> 00:11:10.980
The same for the rest of the things.

178
00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:15.393
The hand was quite simple
because in our first walking pose,

179
00:11:15.393 --> 00:11:19.060
we have a hand in my
pocket and what I did was that,

180
00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:23.220
The hand is kept in the pocket
and a slight movement in the hair.

181
00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.020
If we unlink this from
the translational movement,

182
00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.700
The character does
something like that.

183
00:11:35.568 --> 00:11:39.540
What it does is
simulate more or less a turn,

184
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:44.460
throw a first kick in which
you look for the contact pose

185
00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.460
To start our cycle.

186
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:51.900
Once we have all the character
linked to the translation layer

187
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:56.073
and the transition resolved, we
can put a scene after the other

188
00:11:56.073 --> 00:11:58.340
and it will work quite well.

189
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.720
What I did in this case
was to add a small Time Remap

190
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.780
to the hike layer, since if I didn't,

191
00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:08.938
In my opinion it moved too fast.

192
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.220
Maybe not bad

193
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.803
but as we wanted to give
you a relaxed attitude,

194
00:12:19.803 --> 00:12:21.740
I thought that by adding a Time Remap

195
00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.700
and make the sequence a
little slower, it looked better.

196
00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:29.323
So don't worry too much
about the speed of a cycle,

197
00:12:29.323 --> 00:12:32.340
since, being all vector animation,

198
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:36.140
we can apply a Time Remap quietly,

199
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.725
that After Effects will
interpolate the intermediate frames

200
00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:43.380
and it will be very smooth, it is
not as if we tried to interpolate

201
00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.420
A sequence of images.

202
00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:50.360
For example, here I threw them a lot and
we can see that it looks in slow motion.

203
00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:59.580
We can also play
with that kind of thing.

204
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.280
I finally added the Posterize layer

205
00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:04.420
to lower it to 12 frames per second.

206
00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:08.238
For a walk cycle, 12
frames per second works well.

207
00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.693
Putting everything to our main comp,

208
00:13:15.693 --> 00:13:17.700
We can see how everything looks.

209
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.360
What I am noticing
is that, at the moment

210
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:46.120
in which the character starts to
move, this foot makes rare displacements.

211
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.600
That's because, if we go to the
precomp in which the character

212
00:13:51.613 --> 00:13:54.740
make this transition,
I encouraged these feet

213
00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:57.580
without reference to the floor guides.

214
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.800
Now I will try to
correct it using the guides.

215
00:14:09.745 --> 00:14:12.380
First we unlink all our character

216
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.580
so that it does not move with the
floor, so that it does not move,

217
00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.160
and I'm going to use
that green square ...

218
00:14:19.173 --> 00:14:20.540
or I will duplicate another,

219
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.900
I put it in another color ...

220
00:14:24.003 --> 00:14:26.380
to use it as a
reference for this foot,

221
00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.160
since it is a special movement.

222
00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.540
Here you see the problem.

223
00:14:51.913 --> 00:14:54.900
I think that's fine,
just adjust the line.

224
00:15:02.315 --> 00:15:05.660
Ready, now we link
back torso and legs,

225
00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.740
the whole character to Null X.

226
00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:12.820
We have to link it again
from the point where we did it,

227
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:14.820
in our case it was frame 0.

228
00:15:17.828 --> 00:15:19.260
There we corrected the problem.

229
00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.460
With that we finish one more scene

230
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:39.180
and we are close to
finishing our animation.
