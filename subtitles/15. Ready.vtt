1
00:00:04.663 --> 00:00:08.472
Ready!

2
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.800
Since our animation is ready,

3
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.380
In this last lesson we will
give you postprocessing tweaks

4
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.860
and finally render.

5
00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:23.935
First let's add the
reflection to our character,

6
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.120
which is something we
propose from our styleframe

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.500
and we didn't
consider it in the animation,

8
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.542
but we are going to add it now.

9
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.760
We will enter the first
scene and we will duplicate

10
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.078
our precomp of the
character, we will put another color

11
00:00:39.428 --> 00:00:42.548
and we are simply going to
reverse it with the scale.

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.960
We will give it -100% in the Y
and we will place it on the floor.

13
00:00:48.577 --> 00:00:49.820
It is the advantage of having

14
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.720
all character
animation in a single precomp,

15
00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:56.655
we simply duplicate that and we
already have what happens in there.

16
00:00:57.455 --> 00:00:59.685
We will give this color a reflection

17
00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:02.988
which can be similar
or exactly the same

18
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.853
that we have in the
reflection of the showcase.

19
00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.805
We are going to capture this
color by creating a new figure

20
00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:15.645
and we will use the
eyedropper and we will copy this color.

21
00:01:17.883 --> 00:01:21.680
To the layer of the reflection
we can put Color Correction, Tint.

22
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.133
We will give the same
color code to both colors.

23
00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:28.433
And there we have a
reflection for our character.

24
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.882
We are going to have to
do it with this part too.

25
00:01:47.485 --> 00:01:50.805
We make sure to place the
reflection below the comps,

26
00:01:50.993 --> 00:01:53.353
This way you don't
overlap with the character.

27
00:01:54.248 --> 00:01:58.528
We could give this reflex, if
we wanted, different treatments.

28
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.790
We could, for example, put a Blur

29
00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:04.628
if we want the reflection
of the floor is not so clear.

30
00:02:05.623 --> 00:02:09.533
Or maybe we can use Scatter,

31
00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:12.068
I've used it a lot lately

32
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.363
because it generates a
blur, but with points,

33
00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:15.983
That is interesting there.

34
00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:20.650
But, for now, I seem to
keep this style very flat.

35
00:02:20.652 --> 00:02:24.143
because we don't use any
gradient, no blur elsewhere.

36
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.725
I copy this color for reference

37
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.628
and we continue to
apply the reflection.

38
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.303
I just realized
that the boot animation

39
00:02:39.303 --> 00:02:42.670
It's not in a precomp,
so let's do that first.

40
00:02:43.985 --> 00:02:45.025
Yes now.

41
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.120
Finally, the last scene.

42
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.440
And so I think we would
be with all the reflexes.

43
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.600
Then, this black color,

44
00:03:48.602 --> 00:03:51.170
I think it could be a
color similar to this.

45
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.785
Since we don't use
black anywhere else.

46
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.557
It can be this same color.

47
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.878
For now it's ok.

48
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.198
If they want to end up with a
degree, the credits, whatever.

49
00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:05.708
Once we have all the
animation as we want it,

50
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.705
We can add some effects.

51
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.080
We will create a new
composition based on this,

52
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.560
I usually call him ...

53
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.960
Post because it is postprocessed.

54
00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:21.168
This is going to be the
composition that we will finally render.

55
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.720
The Comp took her to precomps.

56
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:27.513
I usually add a couple
of details as an effect

57
00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.370
to try to make this
image a little softer

58
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.000
and take her away from
this hard vector look.

59
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.680
To begin, I first apply a
small chromatic aberration.

60
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.480
I do this like this:
I double the precomp

61
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.520
already the first precomp,

62
00:04:43.843 --> 00:04:47.042
I go to Layer Styles
and apply any of these,

63
00:04:47.075 --> 00:04:50.035
It is not important
because we are going to delete

64
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.040
the layer style we just added

65
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.590
and the only thing that matters to
us is to show us the Layer Styles

66
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.255
with Blending options.

67
00:04:58.403 --> 00:05:01.003
I don't know if there is
another way for this to appear alone

68
00:05:01.023 --> 00:05:03.788
because if we don't add
any style to the layer,

69
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.028
There is no way to see this, but I
do it this way and it is very easy.

70
00:05:07.043 --> 00:05:10.828
Once inside Blending
Options, we go to Advanced Blending

71
00:05:10.928 --> 00:05:13.128
and we have red, green and blue.

72
00:05:13.447 --> 00:05:15.447
Let's hide the green and the blue

73
00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.593
to leave only red.

74
00:05:17.635 --> 00:05:19.512
If we see this image,
it will look like this.

75
00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:23.427
What we are going to do is the
opposite with the image above,

76
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.720
with the one above.

77
00:05:24.738 --> 00:05:27.548
We copy the Layer Styles
and we will paste them here.

78
00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.800
We will show all but red.

79
00:05:29.802 --> 00:05:32.145
Let's hide the red, Off in the red.

80
00:05:32.147 --> 00:05:34.467
In the Green and in the
Blue we are going to put On.

81
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.240
So, when we show both
images at the same time,

82
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.678
you see the image as we
had it at the beginning,

83
00:05:41.678 --> 00:05:44.592
that is, with all overlapping colors.

84
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.840
The magic of this begins
when we move a layer of place,

85
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.403
which is distorted as
if they were 3D lenses.

86
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.200
So what we do with
this is a subtle shift.

87
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.280
I move this one pixel to the side

88
00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.240
and this generates
us some rims of color

89
00:06:00.253 --> 00:06:01.733
next to each object.

90
00:06:02.188 --> 00:06:05.228
This gives it a slightly
more photographic look,

91
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.260
Even if it is subtle.

92
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.203
It's like adding a small error feature

93
00:06:10.203 --> 00:06:12.010
So that it becomes more organic.

94
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.800
All these kinds of things
are to everyone's taste,

95
00:06:14.808 --> 00:06:17.848
so everyone can apply
the effects they want

96
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.063
or not apply any kind of effects.

97
00:06:20.265 --> 00:06:22.448
In fact, five years or ten years ago,

98
00:06:22.573 --> 00:06:25.373
maybe I would have
put a bullet like that

99
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.405
that darkens the edges,

100
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.280
but I don't like that
anymore and it's not used so much.

101
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.320
It is increasingly used to
leave the style quite flat,

102
00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.560
but I like to add a little noise

103
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.703
and I do that by adding
a solid that has a gray,

104
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.280
that is, it should be 50% gray.

105
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.160
This means that if we add a
noise effect to this layer,

106
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.183
let's say 10%,

107
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.560
We are going to give
you Layer mode, Overlay,

108
00:06:52.853 --> 00:06:56.985
and it will be applied on the
background without distorting the colors much.

109
00:06:57.735 --> 00:07:00.705
The good thing about
wearing a gray cape with Overlay

110
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.315
is that light colors
don't affect us so much

111
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.760
and it doesn't add
noise in light colors,

112
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.480
that sometimes we want to keep

113
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.280
Very pure whites and very blacks.

114
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.262
Let's put this layer Noise.

115
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.040
Another thing that was used a
lot, although now a little less,

116
00:07:17.073 --> 00:07:19.338
It is a little
distortion at the edges.

117
00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:21.568
I keep using that

118
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:24.693
because I like to
avoid these straight edges.

119
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.153
So, we add a new adjustment layer

120
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:32.078
having a distortion
effect, Turbulent Displace.

121
00:07:33.022 --> 00:07:37.788
What it does is deform us with
a pattern throughout our image.

122
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.543
What we are going to do
is configure this a bit.

123
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:43.000
We will put the size very low

124
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.180
So you have barely broken edges.

125
00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.668
Maybe we lower this a bit
so you don't have so much.

126
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.160
We can add little complexity

127
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.765
So you have more detail.

128
00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:55.155
Something like that is fine.

129
00:07:55.493 --> 00:07:57.960
For me, this effect
has to be very subtle

130
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.805
and leave the edges
somewhat sloppy but not too much.

131
00:08:02.117 --> 00:08:05.623
The Noise seems to me to be very
strong, we are going down a five.

132
00:08:06.668 --> 00:08:08.988
If we want to animate
the Turbulent Displace,

133
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.688
as it is done many times,

134
00:08:10.993 --> 00:08:13.712
We have to avoid
encouraging evolution.

135
00:08:14.103 --> 00:08:17.840
I will increase this so that
the example is noticed, only.

136
00:08:17.883 --> 00:08:19.107
Then we lower it.

137
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:24.140
If we change the evolution, we
notice as if we look underwater.

138
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.837
That is not the
effect we want to achieve.

139
00:08:27.847 --> 00:08:30.623
What we want to achieve
is that at every moment

140
00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:34.400
This turbulence looks
different, as it was made by hand.

141
00:08:34.695 --> 00:08:37.625
What we are going to do is
play with the Random Seed.

142
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.040
We are going to give Alt + Click
to this and if we put Time for 500,

143
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:47.530
This is going to make another
Random Seed for each painting.

144
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.640
Then, in each frame this
will change as if it were new.

145
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.610
If we give this
Play, it moves very fast.

146
00:08:54.828 --> 00:08:56.663
Over there what we can do is,

147
00:08:56.665 --> 00:08:59.893
We are going to tell
this expression to change,

148
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.800
not once per frame, that is,
24 times per second, but less.

149
00:09:03.813 --> 00:09:07.198
So, at the beginning of the
expression we will go to Global

150
00:09:07.198 --> 00:09:09.105
and we will put posterizeTime.

151
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:11.360
We put a semicolon to separate that

152
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:16.428
and in Frames per second we
will put eight or four, maybe.

153
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:19.140
So, this makes all this expression

154
00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.863
be postponed to
four frames per second.

155
00:09:22.343 --> 00:09:26.080
So, if we advance several
frames, it won't change us

156
00:09:26.848 --> 00:09:29.358
until it changes
four times per second.

157
00:09:29.583 --> 00:09:32.272
If we give Play, let's
see that this changes,

158
00:09:32.273 --> 00:09:33.983
but less frequently.

159
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.540
Something like that can work.

160
00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:40.333
If we go back to this, to make it more
subtle, maybe it can stay on the edge.

161
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.728
This also helps us add some variety

162
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.413
to static images

163
00:09:45.445 --> 00:09:47.765
and that looks a
little more like he's alive.

164
00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.513
Finally, I experiment
a little with color.

165
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.328
I add a Adjustment layer
and try a couple of things.

166
00:09:56.575 --> 00:09:58.663
Maybe change the balance a bit.

167
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.148
We make the character appear
and turn it a little to the side.

168
00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.630
Maybe the background
we like a little greener

169
00:10:05.648 --> 00:10:07.668
or more for the blue side.

170
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:09.703
We can play with that.

171
00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.232
In this case, this
range convinces me a lot,

172
00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.347
but I think we can
give it a little contrast.

173
00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.978
So, I'm going to add some curves.

174
00:10:18.785 --> 00:10:21.825
I will try to raise blacks a bit,

175
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.880
flatten them and lift over here.

176
00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.100
Maybe something like that,

177
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.520
but the curves not only
give brightness contrast,

178
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.605
but saturate the colors.

179
00:10:33.605 --> 00:10:36.520
So, if we put it in
Luminosity layer mode,

180
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.468
It affects us over value.

181
00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:41.463
Let's see what the part
of the face looks like,

182
00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.190
It is important that
the character looks good.

183
00:10:44.898 --> 00:10:49.018
This maybe makes the
colors close to white

184
00:10:49.033 --> 00:10:51.215
flatten and approach with white.

185
00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:53.860
So, I’m going to see if I
get a little down there,

186
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.257
so we give more contrast in the face.

187
00:10:56.873 --> 00:10:58.270
I like it there a lot.

188
00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.685
This, however, is a
matter of trying a little.

189
00:11:02.815 --> 00:11:06.430
I like it there, but I think
the dark ones were very black.

190
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.720
Maybe something like that.

191
00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:13.943
This I think helps separate a little

192
00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:17.202
the character in the background
and make it a little brighter.

193
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.600
When we are happy with what we add,

194
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.403
We can go to the renderer.

195
00:11:22.993 --> 00:11:25.938
With Control + Shift + 0
we show the render queue

196
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.603
and generally what I do is take out

197
00:11:28.603 --> 00:11:31.843
a version in
Quicktime without compression.

198
00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:35.710
After out in the Media
Converter, I pass it to MP4.

199
00:11:36.135 --> 00:11:40.513
So, here we go to
Custom and choose Quicktime.

200
00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:42.018
It can be Animation

201
00:11:42.018 --> 00:11:45.783
or recently Windows is allowed ProRes,

202
00:11:45.783 --> 00:11:46.960
which is very good

203
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.200
so we can get a ProRes out of here

204
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.640
and then "encode" to
MP4 whenever we want.

205
00:12:12.838 --> 00:12:15.935
With this lesson we
finish our final project.

206
00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.920
Remember that this
process should not be so linear,

207
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
if they must return to previous
stages, they can do it to correct things.

208
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.445
In the next unit, I will share tips

209
00:12:25.445 --> 00:12:27.405
to further improve your animations.
